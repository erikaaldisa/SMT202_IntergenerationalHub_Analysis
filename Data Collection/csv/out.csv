Over eight workshops; the artist engaged a group of seniors in papercrafting activities and discussions about the potentials and pitfalls of community spaces. In an excursion to the URA Centre; the seniors viewed various architectural models to understand how Singapore plans and redevelops its urban spaces. These insights served as inspiration for the seniors to review; further discuss and refine their creations; which culminated in a final show-and-tell.Related:BrochureMichael Lee; Mail Order: Gifts from Heaven (detail); 2008; paper and paper board; dimensions variable; part of “A Psychotaxonomy of Home”; 2008; at Baba House; Singapore.

It is an inventory of words or deeds of a select group of people whom the artist Michael Lee has met in his life. Almost always singular and brief; each meeting nonetheless lurks in the artist’s mind; though he is unable to confidently ascertain the strangers’ intentions or recall ever asking for their names. The work is realised as a collection of pennant flags bearing texts that refer to each encounter. Distilled into the present tense and appearing across both sides of a flag; each textual account reads like a campaign’s call to action. Together; the flags invite remixes and new readings of the interactions; and of a psychological party that is not ending anytime soon.Michael Lee; Friendly Strangers Party (detail); 2019; laser jet print on paper; 100 pennant flags of dimensions 25 x 18 cm each; part of the group exhibition “ONLY CONNECT Osaka”; 2019; curated by Yutaka Inagawa at Creative Center Osaka.

http://sgre.com.sg/ura-to-monitor-outcome-of-first-retirement-village-before-deciding-on-future-land-sites/, Posted On 23 Jan 2014By Wong Siew Ying | POSTED: 23 Jan 2014 19:14 | UPDATED: 23 Jan 2014 23:23 | CNASINGAPOREThe Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said it will monitor and review the outcome of Singapore’s first retirement village before deciding if it will release more land for similar projects in the future; or tweak any parameters.It added that as retirement housing is a relatively new concept in Singapore; it saw merit in giving the market and the developer the flexibility to determine the concept for this new housing development.The Hillford at Jalan Jurong Kechil was a sellout; with all 281 units snapped up in a day.With units priced at around S$400;000 to S$700;000 and its location in the Bukit Timah area; the project attracted buyers; including retirees; young families and some investors.Its developer; World Class Developments; said that a substantial proportion of buyers were over 50 years of age.Sold on a 60-year lease; The Hillford comes with elderly-friendly features and is aimed at providing affordable housing for retirees.“The land sales were loosely defined and… not restricted to people of a certain age; certain cohort nor… restrict them from leasing out the units;” said Alan Cheong; research head at Savills Singapore.“I would believe quite a number of them would have bought it for rental income yield; because (in a) worst case scenario; you still get a five per cent gross yield and that return is even better than the average shoebox (apartments) that you are getting.”Property analysts are mixed as to whether there is scope for the development of more retirement housing projects in the private residential market in Singapore.But they said should the government plan to release more of such sites; stricter conditions must be attached to the tender as the notion of retirement homes may be lost without rules specifying who could buy these units.They added that sites for retirement homes should also be located near healthcare facilities such as a hospital.“The first aspect that the government could consider would be to look at the minimum age for home buyers;” said Alice Tan; associate director and head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank.“The minimum age could be tied in with the mandatory retirement age set by the government. Now the retirement age is 62; (so) I guess the age of 60 and above would be quite palatable.“Secondly; in order to preserve the unique concept of retirement homes; URA could consider releasing sites based on a two-envelope tender that would mean that tenderers who submit their bids for the land sites would also need to submit concepts.”“Incentives or rebates could come to existing projects”; said Desmond Sim; associate director at CBRE Research“Maybe the state could give incentives or rebates for developers to turn some of the units to be more elderly friendly. In that way; there is a guarantee of integration of the elderly.”In addition; analysts said buyers should also consider if such units will be well-received in the resale market.Mr Sim said: “Let’s say you have a lease of six years and (if) you put it out on the market; 54 years will be left. It is untested on the buyer’s side whether the buyer could obtain a loan from the bank to finance the purchase.“Banks are generally quite restrictive in giving loans to properties that have a reduced tenure.”– CNA/echttp://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore/ura-to-monitor-outcome-of/965352.html
http://tsaofoundation.org/doc/dimensions_aging.pdf,SHARON MENGCHEE LEE DIMENSIONS OF AGING IN SINGAPORE* ABSTRACT. This paper reviews research on aging in Singapore. There are three objec- tives to the paper: first; to describe some of the major findings on research on the elderly population in Singapore; secondly; to discuss the role of political authorities in defining and shaping the problems of aging in the country; and finally; to identify the implications that the Singapore case may hold for furthering cross-cultural research on aging. The role of the family in supporting the elderly is observed to be fundamental; and children represent the basic source of old age security. This contrasts with the low level of com- munity and public participation in the support network of elderly Singaporeans. The government's influence in defining the dimensions of the aging problem as primarily a problem of ensuring family responsibilities across generations is also discussed. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research on aging in Singapore. Key Words: Singapore; support; family; elderly; research agenda. INTRODUCTION It may seem surprising that aging is an important social issue in Singapore; a young nation which just recently celebrated 25 years of nation building in 1984. Indeed; the small island republic became a sovereign state only in 1965; after a history of British colonization from 1819 to 1959 (when internal self-government was granted) and a brief stint as a member of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965. Yet as a result of a highly successful family and population planning program and rapid improvements in health care; demographic trends point to a graying of Singapore's population. In 1947; only 1.8% of the population was 65 years and older; in 1980; this had increased to 4.7%; and it is projected that by 2010; 9.2% of the popula- tion will be in this category of the elderly (Ministry of Health 1984). These figures may appear to be little cause for concern when compared with the much higher proportion of old people in the advanced nations of the west and Japan. However; the aging of Singapore's population has emerged as a social problem following the release of a government report on the elderly in 1984 (Ministry of Health 1984). Before the report; aging and the problems of the aged had received scant attention in Singapore. Public resources were more urgently required for education; housing; economic development; family planning and health services. The results of these efforts have been impressive. For example; the general literacy rate for the population over 10 years old was 85% in 1982 compared to just 43% in 1957. Over 80% of the population live in modern public housing constructed by the government statutory body Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology 1 (1986) 239--254. Âcopyrighted  1986 by D. Reidel Publishing Company. 240 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE called the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Singapore's economy is one of the fastest growing in Asia: real GNP growth was 9.7% in 1981; 6.5% in 1982 and 8% in 1983. Corresponding figures for 1982 and 1983 for Japan and the U.S. are 3% and 3%; -1.9% and 3.5%; respectively (Singapore Department of Statistics 1983/84). The per capita GNP in 1982 was the second highest in Asia; behind Japan's. The changes with the most direct impact on aging are family planning and increased life expectancy. Annual population growth rate was 4.4% in 1957 (Saw 1981: Table 1.1); since 1979; as a result of an aggressive family planning program; population growth has declined to about 1.5%. Infant mortality has dropped from 20 per 1;000 live births in 1973 to 9.3 per 1;000 live births in 1983; life expectancy for women climbed to 74 years and 69 years for men in 1983 (Department of Statistics 1983/84). These develop- ments have produced significant implications for the age composition of the population and heightened awareness of a growing old age dependency. In this paper; I will first review the major findings on some dimensions of aging in Singapore. Because of the paucity of research on the elderly in Singapore; much of the discussion will focus on the support system of the elderly. Data will be based on various government and government- sponsored reports concerning the elderly; and research projects conducted by students at the National University of Singapore. The latter source of information may strike some readers as rather unusual; but in view of the short tradition of social science research in Singapore; much important information about Singaporean society is produced by student projects known as "Academic Exercises". 1 It should also be noted that the data are of uneven quality and differ in orientation given the authors' different objectives. This problem is unfortunately inevitable until more and better research on the elderly in Singapore is conducted. A second goal of this paper is to comment on the role of political authorities in defining and shaping social problems; in this case; the problem of aging in Singapore. This is related to what has become the central issue of aging in Singapore; that of how best to ensure family support of the elderly. Finally; I will discuss some implications that the Singapore case may hold for the cross-cultural study of social gerontology. DIMENSIONS OF AGING 1. Who Are the "Aged"? Unless death occurs prematurely; all biological organisms undergo the process of degeneration described as "aging". The physical aging of humans is relatively uniform although significant differences associated SINGAPORE ELDERLY 241 with dietary; exercise and life-style variations have been extensively documented. However; the relationship between physiological aging and psychological and social aging is problematic; Neuhaus and Neuhaus (1982); for example; provide a good review of the complex connections between these different dimensions of aging. There is also disagreement on when an individual is "old". References to the elderly are commonly based on chronological age and tend to be statistical conveniences rather than meaningful sociological concepts. Recent categorization of the elderly into the "young-old" (usually between 60 or 65 to 70 or 75 years old) andthe "old-old" (those over 75 years old) represent attempts to "better" capture the diversity of the so-called elderly population. The question of who the elderly are is also seen in Singapore. The official retirement age is 55; and some reports on the elderly in Singapore used this to define their samples (Cheung 1976; Sob 1976). With life expectancy at around 70; 55 appears to be too "young" to qualify one as a member of the aged population. The latest report on the elderly which was released by the Ministry of Health in 1984 defined the elderly as those 65 years and over. While this may be a better measure- ment of the elderly population; the definition is far from objective; the "aging" of the elderly in Singapore from 55 to 65 is closely related to official plans to raise the retirement age and therefore the age at which the people may withdraw their pension funds. 2 Thus; just as in other societies; Singapore is also faced with the problem of deciding who the elderly are. How this issue is resolved is very clearly related to changing social; demographic and political trends. 2. Support System of the Elderly In this section; I will review the major findings on the support system of the elderly in Singapore. The relative contributions of the family and community in this support network are discussed; where possible; similar- ities and differences with other societies will be drawn. (a) Family support in old age. One question that social gerontologists often ask is whether changes in family structure and processes have affected inter-generational relations and care of the elderly. For a long time; it was believed that the nuclear family form is not compatible with the maintenance of support relations for elderly parents. However; recent research on the family suggest that there may be more myth than reality to this breakdown of the traditional functions of the family. Sussman (1965) and Konig (1970); for example; successfully question the recency of the nuclear family. They argue that nuclear families were the most common family form in the past since only the prosperous could sustain an extended family. In addition; the belief that nuclear families live in 242 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE isolation has been exposed as unfounded; most family units form parts of wider networks of kin relationships. Shanas (1962; 1973); Brody (1978); Blenkner (1965) and Weeks and Cuellar (1981); among others; have reported on the predominantly family-based help and social networks of the elderly in the United States. Townsend's (1963) classic study of the family life of old people in England also underlines the continuity of family life and support relations for the elderly. As Riley puts it; "people do not grow old alone; they live in a net of family relationships" (Riley; Hess; and Bond 1983: 3). Therefore; the research picture on the role of the family in supporting the elderly in Western nations shows that while the nuclear family (or some form of it) may be the most common family form; this has not led to any decline in the family's role in the lives of the elderly. Singapore is an Asian society characterized by the cultural traditions of its majority Chinese population (76% of the population) descended from immigrants from China; its other major immigrant group of Indians (6%); and the indigenous Malay population (16%). Singaporeans of all ethnic backgrounds believe; or at least; assume; that their Asian heritage teaches respect and filial attitudes toward the elderly. At the same time; there is growing concern; especially among certain official circles; about the increased "Westernization" of the younger generation. Westernization is often associated with the breakdown of the traditional Asian family structure and bonds; the Ministry of Health's Committee on the Aged (1984: 15) deplored the growing prevalence of a "Western ... material- istic; self-oriented and individualistic way of life" and expressed deep concern for the proper care of the elderly as a result of these develop- ments. The official perception of Western societies represented in this particular report is apparently not unique; exposure to Western values and life-styles; especially through the mass media; is widely believed to be detrimental to the "positive" Asian values on the family (Chen and Chang 1982; Singapore Council of Social Services 1981a). Using the available sources of data; I will evaluate the support role of the family for the elderly against these expressions of concern. Three studies contain information on the living and housing arrange- ments of their elderly respondents; and all three report that most of their respondents live with their families. 79% of Chen and Chang's (1982) respondents live with adult children (sample size was 1086; respondents were 55 years and older); Soh (1976) reports that 81% of the sample of 50 elderly individuals studied live with family members; and over 70% stated that their children would never allow them to live in homes for the elderly even if they had wanted to. In the third study; Cheung (1976) interviewed 43 "poor" and 25 "well-off" individuals aged 60 and over; and found that while 85% of the well-off elderly lived with family members; only 26% of the elderly poor did. 3 SINGAPORE ELDERLY 243 These three studies indicate that most of the elderly shared homes with adult children; and were happy to share such living arrangements. In addition to living space; almost all of Cheung's (1976) respondents agreed that children should provide financial support to their aged parents and the 80% who did receive such support were "content" to be so supported. The younger generation also subscribed to this pattern of filial obligation; according to Chen and Chang's (1982) survey; although there were some differences in degree of adherence to this responsibility; for example; women and more highly-educated respondents were more likely to express doubts about sharing homes although providing monetary assist- ance was not perceived to be problematic. Based on these reports; it appears that the family is the primary provider of basic help and support to the elderly in Singapore. If an elderly person has adult children; the chances are very high that he or she will share a home with one of the children. Two important points emerge from these studies on the housing and financial support of the aged in Singapore. First of all; the importance of children as the major source of old age security is clearly demonstrated. The elderly poor; i.e.; those receiving public support; are less likely to have family members who could provide housing and financial help while the elderly with family members; especially adult children; fare much better. Singaporeans expect their children to support them in their old age; and are quite happy to depend on their children when they are old. This contrasts with certain Western values of independence which motivate people to plan for their own support when they are old; or which discourage them from turning to their adult children for financial support. Cantor (1979) discusses the role of such values on relations between the elderly and their children in the United States; where support relations across the generations tend to emphasize emotional and psychological help. Thus; the family is perhaps more important for elderly Singaporeans since they depend on the family to provide fundamental support; such as housing and financial assistance. There are at least two factors which may account for the importance of the family in the support system of the elderly in Singapore. One factor is the lack of a comprehensive social security and retirement benefits system. The closest attempt to institutionalize retirement provisions is the Central Provident Fund (CPF); which was established in 1955 and covers all workers in the labor force except for employers; the self-employed and unpaid family workers. In addition; if the worker's monthly wage is less than $200; 4 the worker need not contribute to the fund but his or her employer must contribute 25% of the worker's wage each month to the worker's CPF account. As of January 1; 1984; the rates of contribution (which are mandated by law) were 25% from the employer; subject to a maximum of $695; and 25% (no ceiling) from the employee; each month. However; since the fund was only established in 1955; most of the present 244 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE generation of elderly Singaporeans do not belong to it. Only 9.1% of the fund's members in 1982 were 50 years and older; out of a total member- ship of 1;725;300. In addition; the largest group of members (14.2%) had balances of less than $200 in their accounts; an amount that is clearly insufficient for self-maintenance upon retirement from the work force (Singapore Yearbook of Statistics 1982/83). The low balances can be largely attributed to the fact that fund members are allowed to draw on their accounts to purchase housing; certain government-sponsored insur- ance plans and shares in a few government-operated companies. Thus; while this has encouraged home ownership among Singaporeans; the fundamental objective of the fund as a retirement fund is undermined. According to Chen and Chang's (1982) study; only 2.3% of their elderly respondents counted on the CPF or other pension funds for monetary support in their old age; they expected their children to provide for their old age. Another reason for the emphasis on economic support across the generations and the dependence on children may be the cultural traditions of the Chinese who; so far; have been the only ethnic group studied in these reports on the elderly in Singapore. Many of those interviewed expressed a strong preference for living with an adult son and his family; and also tended to depend on sons for financial support. The prescribed role of male children as supporters of elderly parents was shared by younger respondents. For example; 56% of the younger respondents surveyed by Chen and Chang (1982) believe that the best living arrange- ment for older people is to live with a married son; or at least; to live close to a married son (26% gave the latter as a second choice). The patriarchal traditions of the Chinese must be considered in understanding the role of adult children; in particular; sons; in the support system of the elderly in Singapore. However; it should be noted that this is probably true only of the Chinese and Indian populations; Malay cultural traditions are less male-dominated and I suspect the mother-daughter bond may be more useful in examining the role of the family for the elderly Malay. The strength of the parent-son relationship among Chinese Singaporeans is another contrast with the central role of women in the family support networks in the West documented by Townsend (1963) and Blenkner (1965); among others; s Secondly; these studies on the elderly in Singapore also highlight the plight of the impoverished old; many of whom lacked a family support network to provide housing and financial assistance. More of the elderly poor lived alone and felt neglected; lonely and resigned (Cheung 1976). The same study also reports that financial problems were acute for 74% of the elderly who were poor. The difficulties encountered by this group serve to underline the importance of the family in supporting the elderly in Singapore. At the same time; the experience of this group demonstrates SINGAPORE ELDERLY 245 the limitations of a support system that is primarily dependent on the family; and the need to address the concerns of the elderly who do not fit into the conventional family life-cycle model (such as the single; childless; and widowed). Bytheway (1979) and Nock (1979) have argued for innovative ways to address the needs of elderly people whose life statuses depart from the conventional family life-cycle model; alternatives to the family life-cycle approach should also be useful for research on the elderly in Singapore. Many of the elderly poor who live alone are first generation immigrants who either never married or do not have living adult children. To sum up the role of the family in supporting the elderly in Singapore; it can be seen that just as in many Western societies; the family remains the major component in the support system. The contribution of the Singaporean family is; however; different in many respects. The primary line of support is along financial and physical dimensions; such as in providing a shared living space. Little published evidence is available on emotional and psychological support across the generations (indeed; the neglect of such dimensions of support in the research conducted so far may be significant in its implications for the role of emotional support of the elderly by the younger generation). In addition; the parent-son bond seems to be the fundamental relationship that sustains the family's role in old age in Singapore. In the next section; I will turn to the contributions of the community in the support system of the elderly. (b) Community support of the elderly. One of the most serious difficulties that elderly people face is the drop in income following retirement from the labor force. This affects the retiree and his or her dependent spouse; and is particularly stressful when social security provisions are inadequate or medical expenses are high. Blau (1973) concludes that for most old people in the U.S.; where there is a system of social security and retire- ment benefits; it is still difficult to entirely escape the financial deficit and other stresses following the role-exits associated with retirement. Age as a correlate of stratification is generally acknowledged; in 1972; Field (1972) estimated that 1/3 of the elderly in the U.S. had incomes that placed them below the official poverty line. This had improved to "just" a 14.1% poverty rate among the population aged 65 and over in 1983 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1984). The financial problems of the elderly are especially worrisome for those who live in societies where family care and support is perceived as a private matter. Being poor for the elderly in Singapore is clearly asso- ciated with the absence of a family-based support system. The~ official retirement age is 55; and labor force participation declines rapidly with age (see Table I). On retirement; income is substantially reduced; but it has already been shown that the elderly in Singapore do not have sufficient means of 246 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE TABLE I Age specific labor force participation rate (per 100 population); 1982 Age Group Total Male Female 10 orover 63.4 81.5 45.2 55--59 47.8 75.4 18.6 60--64 31.4 53.9 10.0 65--69 23.5 39.1 9.6 70--74 16.3 27.7 6.7 75 & over 6.9 13.0 3.0 Source: Singapore Yearbook of Statistics 19 8 2/8 3. self-support in old age. Chen and Chang (1982) report that over 60% of the elderly in their study were not financially independent. The family is expected to; and in most cases; does; perform the role of provider for the elderly in Singapore. Where this is not possible for a variety of reasons; the elderly person has to seek assistance from the community. Information on community sources of financial aid for the elderly is not easily available; but whatever data there are suggest that such community help is woefully inadequate. It was estimated that 48% of the "aged destitute" in fiscal year 1978/79 did not receive any assistance from the public assist- ance scheme administered by the Department of Social Welfare of the Ministry of Social Affairs (Wong 1980). Of those 52% who did obtain help from this agency; the level of such support can be seen from Table II.

Source: Singapore Council of Social Services; 1981b: Table B. SINGAPORE ELDERLY 247 Field (1972) had chastised the level of public assistance to the elderly in the U.S. as "niggardly"; stringent eligibility requirements and bureau- cratic red tape often conspired to humiliate the applicant for such assistance. The current state of official aid to the elderly in Singapore appears to represent a grim echo of this hopefully former attitude toward the elderly in the U.S.; indeed; it seems that the conditions are worse in Singapore. Note that the low level of help available is considered "relief"; not "subsistence". Thus; only the truly "destitute" may qualify. It is not clear where the aged destitute can go for help beyond this "refief". Wong (1980) commented briefly on the charity organizations to whom the aged poor can theoretically turn for additional aid; but concluded that the process for obtaining such aid is tedious; difficult; and too often unsuc- cessful. Another major need of the elderly without family support is for housing. Cheung (1976) reports that the elderly poor in his study spent at least 1/4 of their total income on housing. As stated earlier; more than 80% of Singaporeans live in government-constructed and maintained high-rise apartments. These represent the only affordable housing for the majority of Singaporeans who live in one of the most expensive and land-scarce cities of the world. Through its policies of application and allocation of housing; the government is able to promote certain values on the family; for example; young singles do not qualify for HDB housing and one must be over 45 (for women) or 50 (for men) in order to apply for HDB housing as single individuals (even then; there are rules on sharing of apartments by such single applicants). In addition; to promote sharing housing with one's elderly parents; higher priority is given to families who apply for apartments as "three-tier families" (that is; families composed of members spanning three generations). These housing policies have the general effect of making it difficult for the elderly without family members to obtain inexpensive government housing. The priority awarded to three-tier families has also led to some undocumented but widely believed abuses of elderly parents who are used to obtain housing but are subsequently mistreated by their children. There are only two real options available to the elderly who cannot qualify for HDB housing or who cannot afford to jointly rent an HDB flat with another elderly person. Some voluntary charity organizations operate homes for the aged; such as the homes maintained by various Chinese temples; Chinese clan associations and Christian missions. However; a survey by the Singapore Council of Social Services (198 l a) on the supply of such housing indicates that the demand far exceeds supply. The shortage is especially acute for the elderly sick and non-ambulant. A second possibility are the government-operated homes; but these are only for the "truly destitute" and are even fewer in number than the homes maintained by charity organizations. Finally; there are a few commercial 248 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE nursing homes which are too expensive for the elderly poor but which represent an alternative for those who can afford to choose not to live with their children. Besides housing and financial assistance; community support of the elderly can assume other forms; such as the provision of nursing help for the elderly sick and food for those in need. Unfortunately; the level of such support in Singapore is not much better than that in housing and monetary aid. The Singapore Council of Social Services (1981a) con- cluded that medical information on the health status and needs of the elderly as a special group is almost non-existent; the little information there is suggests that there is a real lack of such services for the aged; although a section on geriatric medicine has just been established in the Singapore General Hospital in early 1985. Domiciliary nursing for the elderly sick is supposed to be provided on a voluntary basis by the Home Nursing Foundation but Wong (1981) estimated that in 1979; only 4.4% of the approximately 15;000 people needing such services received them. Another source of community service for the elderly have been day care centers established in some housing estates (complexes of high-rise apartment buildings; shops; etc.) where the elderly may spend the day outside of their homes. The response to these centers has been very poor; according to the Singapore Council of Social Services (1981a); although the reasons for the lack of interest are not clear. Other community-based support services for the elderly such as good neighbor programs; meals on wheels and home help have all been put forward in the various surveys on the elderly in Singapore (for example; Wong 1980; Singapore Council of Social Services 1981 a); but most are still unavailable. From the above review; the level of community support services for the elderly in Singapore appears to be quite low. The major task of providing assistance to those elderly without a family support system has fallen on voluntary charity organizations. While their contributions are essential in the face of a non-interventionist attitude on the part of official agencies; charity operations are clearly inadequate given the demands and diverse needs of the elderly population. In the next section; I will turn to a discussion of the role of political authorities in defining and shaping official policies on the elderly in Singapore; and the implications for the status of the elderly in that country. 3. The Government and Aging in Singapore I have already referred to the impact of the Ministry of Health's (1984) report on the elderly in Singapore in creating widespread publicity and discussion of the aging of Singapore's population. The report contains vital information on the official ideology on this issue. One theme dominates the Ministry's report on the elderly: the elderly must remain in the family SINGAPORE ELDERLY 249 and it is the family's responsibility to provide for the aged in society. Thus; other potential sources of support and aid for the elderly; such as government agencies; voluntary organizations and commercial (private) services; are to be kept to the barest minimum. A secondary and related message contained in the report focuses on the breakdown of the tradi- tional Asian family and the negative consequences for the status of the aged. A discontinuity in the socialization of the younger generation was perceived; specifically; Western influences on morals; family and individ- ualism were regarded as eroding the filial relationship between children and parents. It was feared that this could only produce a breakdown of the traditional Asian family's care of; and responsibility to; the older genera- tion. I have briefly referred to recent research which indicates that such perceptions of the Western family are unfounded; however; because the political authorities in Singapore choose to believe and publicize this particular interpretation of Western culture; it is necessary to examine the context in which this belief is perpetuated and the consequences for understanding the aging process in Singapore. While it is impossible to address the history of political development in Singapore in this paper; I will attempt to sketch the major relevant points of the political system which I believe touch on the subject of aging. The present government is formed by the People's Action Party (PAP); headed by Lee Kuan Yew; who is the Prime Minister. The PAP has held political power in Singapore ever since elections for the assembly were first held in 1959 (when Britain granted internal self-government to the colony of Singapore). Lee has been the only Prime Minister the country has ever known. Political analysts and other interested observers of the Singapore political scene agree that understanding Lee is the major factor in under- standing what goes on in Singapore; given the tight control that he has held over the political system of the country. One can only guess at what the Prime Minister believes in through examination of the policies that have been introduced over the years; in this paper; I will try to identify the major ideological strands that touch on the family and the elderly. I propose to do this by discussing one example of government policy on the family; the introduction of moral education in the school system; although I recognize that this can only be suggestive of the role played by political authorities in the problem of aging. The Singaporean education system is a public enterprise defined and operated by the government. The education system has undergone numerous changes. The most important change deals with the languages taught and used in the schools. The current system is quite complex; and is founded on the early tracking of children into different "streams" from the age of nine; children are tracked based primarily on their linguistic and mathematical abilities. 6 Another change in the education system dealt with the introduction of "moral education" into the classroom curriculum in the 250 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE early 1980s; the implementation of this policy is not complete pending the training of teachers and the definition of different courses. The decision to teach moral education in the schools is closely related to the official ideology on the family; and the elderly. One component of the moral education curriculum is Confucian Ethics; and one fundamental (if not the most important) cornerstone of Confucianism is filial piety. It should be noted that students can choose from a number of "moral education" subjects; most of which are essentially the study of different religious systems; for example; Christianity; Islam and Buddhism; but the com- ponent which received the greatest attention and publicity was Confucian Ethics. Between 1982 and 1983; a number of eminent scholars on Confucianism were flown into Singapore from prestigious universities in the U.S. and accorded many opportunities to praise the relevance and significance of Confucianism for a society like Singapore. Related to the introduction of Confucian Ethics into the school curriculum are the frequent speeches by officials on the superiority of the traditional Asian (meaning Chinese) values regarding the family; as I have pointed to earlier; these pronouncements are often based on a misunder- standing of the strength of family bonds in the west. Indeed; the perceived breakdown of the traditional Asian family that is believed to be caused by exposure to Western values has led to a suggestion by the Ministry of Health's (1984) report on the elderly that Singapore introduce laws to ensure the support of elderly parents by the younger generation. On a less serious note; the Ministry's committee which wrote the report also recommended that the Ministry of Culture; which controls the mass communications system; institute a mass education campaign to instil filial piety in Singaporeans and to "shame" those who would abandon their elderly parents. It is easy to observe the role of the government in Singapore in almost all areas of social interaction; the political authorities are unabashedly explicit in their belief that their policies are best for the people and society. Thus; when moral education was introduced into the classroom agenda; the debate was not over what moral education is and the goals of moral education; discussion was at the level of how best to implement the teaching of a taken-for-granted good. The experts on Confucianism who were brought in at tremendous expense tended to act as persuaders of the public rather than objective appraisers of the education system and how Confucianism fits into the system. The high level of publicity and resources devoted to the teaching of Confucian Ethics demonstrates; I believe; the deep concern that the current political authorities have regarding family care and support of the elderly. This is reinforced by a conscious policy of minimalist state participation in providing support services to the elderly. In addition; the frequent criticisms directed at the perceived negative effects of Western culture by various government SINGAPORE ELDERLY 251 representatives can be interpreted as part of an overall policy aimed at promoting family responsibility towards the elderly. Taken together; these developments have encouraged the definition of the problem of aging in Singapore as one of how best to ensure the proper care of the elderly by the family. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This paper has been necessarily brief in reviewing the state of knowledge about the elderly in Singapore because of the short history of research on this topic. My goal was to present a starting point from which future research on the elderly in Singapore could develop; to this end; I had consciously focused on some of the shortcomings and deficiencies in the existing literature; hoping that the future research agenda will fill in these gaps. The major points that emerge from my review of the current stock of research on the elderly in Singapore are: (1) The family remains the basic unit of support for the elderly. Both elderly parents and their adult children believe that it is only right for children to care for their aged parents. (2) Within the family support system of the elderly; the parent-son bond forms the base. In addition; the support relationship is focused on financial and housing support of elderly parents. (3) The contribution by community and official sources to the support system of the elderly in Singapore is minimal. The reasons for this are complex; but the role of government ideology on the family and traditional cultural values which sustain family responsibilities must be considered if a better understanding of this support system is to be gained. (4) The elderly poor were identified as a group which could use greater assistance from the community. Most of the elderly poor did not have families to provide fundamental support services; given the inade- quate level of community and official help; the plight of this group is clearly in need of urgent attention. (5) Singapore's population is pluralistic and presents an ethnic and cultural diversity which is expected to influence how the elderly of each ethnic community interact with family members and the larger community. There is no information on ethnic differences on aging in Singapore. As I had suggested earlier; the parent-son bond of the Chinese may not be found; or may not be as strong; among the Malays. (6) The association between old age and poverty is widely recognized in the west. In addition; many of the older people are female; given the longer life expectancy of women in most industrialized societies. Singapo- rean women also enjoy a longer life span; but very little information exists 252 SHARON MENGCHEE LEE on the possibly different aging experiences of men and women in Singapore. This is another area in need of further investigation. (7) Finally; while none of the existing reports on the elderly in Singapore inquired into the emotional and psychological well-being of the aged other than cursory questions on whether the elderly person felt lonely; other indicators suggest that quick action is needed to find out more about the elderly and to provide greater assistance to those elderly in need. For example; suicide rates increase dramatically with age for both sexes; but the increase is much larger among men: from 1969--1976; while the total suicide rate for the population was 13.9 per 100;000 for males and 10.3 per 100;000 for females; males aged 60--69 had a suicide rate of 62.4 per 100;000; and those over 70 years old had a suicide rate of 136.1 per 100;000. The corresponding rates for older women were 26.1 and 57.8 per 100;000. These figures come from Hassan (1983: 62) who employs a Durkheimian perspective to suggest that "the high pro- pensity for suicide among the aged is ... a function of the absence of a system of community (emphasis added) care which invariably leads to a weakening of individual bonds with society; as well as with 'family society' and with certain cultural ideas about old age". These data on suicide and old age in Singapore is compelling reason enough for official action to aid those at greatest risk. Much remains to be documented on Singapore's experience with its aging population. As an Asian society undergoing rapid changes and trying to achieve a balance between its Asian identity and as a member of the international community; I believe its experience can be informative for other developing societies such as its neighbor; Malaysia; and other newly-industrializing nations such as Taiwan and Hong Kong with pre- dominantly Chinese populations. Indeed; the policy-makers of Singapore can probably learn much from Taiwan and Japan; two countries who are further along in the aging of their populations. In this paper; I have only begun to sketch the main dimensions of the aging problem in Singapore; the task ahead is large but necessary if the goal is to facilitate the satisfactory transition of the population as it ages. NOTES i "Academic Exercises" are research reports based on field work. This is required of students who have been admitted to a fourth year of study in the university to work towards graduation from college with an honors degree; students who do not qualify for the fourth year graduate with a "general" degree after three years. Many of the academic exercises submitted by sociology and social work students represent the only information available on various aspects of Singaporean society. z The Ministry of Health's (1984) report on the elderly (which was released in mid-1984) contained a recommendation that the retirement age be raised to 65; from the current 55. SINGAPORE ELDERLY 253 This recommendation aroused much debate because withdrawal of CPF funds is based on retirement; and many feared that they would be forced to work longer and may not live to retrieve their contributions. In an article written for the Far Eastern Economic Review; Kaye (1984) discussed some of the problems associated with any attempts to raise the retirement age and therefore; when an individual may withdraw his or her CPF funds. For example; raising the age of withdrawal of CPF money will probably be especially hard on low-income individuals who are more dependent on this source for income in the later years. Much of the controversy on this subject was also provoked by certain official comments that Singaporeans were not using their CPF money wisely; thus; it was better if the money remained in the CPF longer (as can be expected; this attitude did not go over well). In Cheung's (1976) study; "poor" respondents were those receiving some form of public assistance; "well-off" respondents simply referred to individuals who had personal or family sources of income. 4 All currency cited are in Singapore dollars; approximate current exchange rate; October 1985:USS1 = SS2.23. 5 While the parent-son relationship is stressed; it remains to be seen if the daily care and help of elderly parent does not fall on the shoulders of either daughters or danghters-in- law. 6 The current education system is based on a report prepared by a special committee appointed by the Prime Minister in 1979. It operates on the twin principles of merit and efficiency. Students are tested regularly and frequently to separate the "bright" from the "not-so-bright" into different streams or tracks. The first differentiation occurs at the end of Primary 3 (students are about nine years old then) when children are tracked into one of three streams: a normal bilingual stream; an extended bilingual stream and a monolingual stream. Those in the first two streams (bilingual) are taught a similar curriculum; using English and one other language (Mandarin; Malay; or Tamil; depending on the child's ethnic background) except that the "normal" stream takes 3 years and the "extended" stream stretches over 5 years. Children in the monolingual stream are considered less able to study two languages and are instructed in just one language; the curriculum is also slightly altered and five years are needed before the students proceed to vocational schools. The bilingual children; on the other hand; will continued to be tested and differen- tiated in secondary school; pre-university or junior college; and finally; at the university level.

http://www.asiaone.com/health/ageing-singapore-get-first-retirement-village,TRENDINGVIDEOS TO WATCHLIFESTYLEHome WorksIN CASE YOU MISSED ITSERVICES SINGAPORE - After more than two decades of debate and deliberation; Singapore's first retirement living community will finally be built at Jalan Jurong Kechil.Property developer World Class Land (WCL); a subsidiary of jewellery group Aspial Corp; told The Sunday Times last week that it plans to build the facility on a 10;170 sq m plot of land; roughly the size of 11/2 football fields.It won a tender last November by offering close to $75 million for the 60-year leasehold land earmarked for residential use.The tender documents said the developer is free to build private flats; condominium units or a retirement living community. At the time; WCL did not reveal which option it would take up.Contacted last week; a spokesman said the company is excited about the project; but is not ready to reveal what will come up. "The details are still in the planning stage and subject to approval from the authorities;" she said.The project has to be completed within five years of the tender being awarded; which means by November in 2017.A spokesman for the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said the site was released with special conditions "to facilitate the development of a private retirement housing product by the market".These include:Removal of restrictions on the maximum number of units that can be built - popularly known as the "anti-shoebox rule". This will allow the developer to build smaller studio apartments popular in retirement communities overseas.Singapore is among the fastest ageing countries in the world. The number of those aged 65 and above will nearly double over the next few years; from 352;000 in 2011 to 600;000 by 2020.The news of the future development was applauded by retirees; like Mr Ngiam Tong Yuen; who have been waiting for such living options for years.The engineer and his wife; Jean; who are in their mid-70s; live in a spacious bungalow in Braddell Heights. "This place is far too big for us;" he said.But a smaller flat is not all that he is looking for."A retirement community can offer seniors much-needed companionship from like-minded peers;" said the father of two adult children. "That's especially vital if; as you age; you lose your spouse or your friends."Senior living champions such as Mr Tan Kee Hian; while equally excited; added a word of caution."A senior living facility is much more than building just a block of flats;" said Mr Tan; who spent two years trying to raise capital to start a retirement village. Its value comes from the services; facilities and on-site care management; such as having a dedicated village manager to deliver high-quality services and nurture a community."I hope the developers pay heed not just to the housing needs but also the lifestyle and care services; which are what seniors want and value more."While Mr Tan hopes more land with similar senior-friendly incentives will be made available for retirement villages; the authorities are taking a more cautious approach.Said the URA spokesman: "We are monitoring the response and outcome of this pilot site before deciding whether more such sites will be released in future."Get a copy of The Straits Times or go to straitstimes.com for more stories. 
http://www.jeraldinephneah.com/singapore-elderly-population-poor/, I was pretty disappointed to read Tan Chuan Jin’s latest Facebook post on the poor elderly in Singapore who work as cardboard collectors.Quoting him:The word that irked me the most in his status update was “some”. The reality is that MOST cardboard collectors do it for the money not “some”. The usage of the word “some” made it seem like he was trivializing the circumstances of the poor elderly.It is indisputable fact that a large proportion of elderly Singaporeans here are poor. In a 2015 paper on elderly poverty in Singapore; Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy showed that the poverty rate among the working elderly jumped from 13 per cent in 1995; to 28 per cent in 2005 –  to 41 per cent in 2011.According to Manpower Ministry figures; in 2016 about 23 per cent of persons over 65 in the formal workforce were earning less than S$1;000 a month.The Singapore Government’s inability to help our elderly people age with dignity has also been criticized by Dr Alexandre Kalache who spent 15 years crafting ageing policies at the World Health Organization. “I am all for active ageing; but if you have never had a decent job; don’t know what job satisfaction is; to make you work till you practically drop dead is not human;” he said.He pointed out that unlike Singapore; much of the developed world already had “non-contributory pensions” for low-income older folk; saving them the indignity of hard labour at a time in life when many may want to retire and rest.Why did the elderly who collect cardboard claim they were doing it for fun or exercise then? According to NUS Sociologist Daniel Goh; there could be more than one reason why a person does it.Many seniors are likely collecting cardboards because they want some exercise; desire independence AND so they can survive. That seniors collect cardboards because they seek exercise does not mean that they are not driven to it by poverty.Another bigger reason was the need for “Face” and dignity. The Singapore culture treats begging as humiliating and values independence and hard work.As Goh explains “Few Singaporeans would be okay with seeing themselves as poor. So when they come face to face with the young people taking a strange sympathetic interest in them; what more would they say if they were to keep their sense of dignity?”Daniel Goh’s observation is supported by Mohd Nafiz Kamarudin; one of the founders of Happy People Helping People Foundation; who has befriended and assisted cardboard box collectors living in Toa Payoh since 2013:“Many of these cardboard box collectors don’t want to admit they are in difficulty…They prefer to collect the boxes and sell them rather than ask for financial assistance;”  What factors then contribute to the pathetic state of many elderly people in Singapore today? Here are some of my thoughts:Singapore has developed rapidly to become one of the world’s most prosperous countries over the past few decades.However; the indicators mean nothing as only a small proportion of people are enjoying this wealth. Our income inequality is one of the highest globally. Most people can’t afford a car due to high COE prices and have no option except for the public transportation which is rapidly declining in standards due to it’s inability to cope with overwhelming number of riders.The poor elderly in Singapore is one of the key groups which have been left out in this process. The government has failed to take into consideration factors like…In contrast to how our other developed counterparts are supporting their elderly; Singapore is doing little. Of course; recently there was also the Pioneer Generation package which was introduced in 2014. It is a little late but a good thing nonetheless.Before their election scare in mid-2011; I felt the ruling party didn’t give a hoot about the poor elderly people. So after their series of welfare measures since then; I truly believe a multiparty system is a good one for Singapore to keep the dominant one in touch with ground sentiments.Many also perceive elderly poverty as the ruling party breaking a central promise it had made to them: “that in return for being obliged to save a large part of their earnings; they would enjoy a carefree retirement”.Thus; I often shudder when others callously proclaim that poor people in Singapore deserve what they got since we’re a meritocratic country because clearly; these senior citizens do not.Further Reading: What are some things that Malaysia gets right but Singapore doesn’t – Mandatory Retirement Savings Our language policy of eliminating other Chinese languages outside of Mandarin has marginalized the senior citizens economically in Singapore as many of them are only able to speak Hokkien; Teochew; Cantonese etc.How does this isolate them?Many are unable to work in the service industry such as receptionists or customer service. Thus; their only options are manual labour which does not involve interaction with others such as picking up scrap cans or cardboards; cleaning tables etc.The lack of language skills also affects their social mobility. They are unable to pick up skills to upgrade themselves. Sure; there are plenty of English and Mandarin courses in Singapore. But; how many of them actually cater to people whose only languages are Hokkien or Cantonese? Even if there were lessons available; poor people would rather spend time earning money than on these things.In other words; the economic situation of many elderly citizens in Singapore are as terrible as migrants from Africa or Middle East who can’t speak a word of English in the UK.Not only are they isolated from economic opportunities; they are isolated in their own families. It is only in Singapore where grand children cannot even communicate with their own grandparents.Singapore claims to embody traditional Asian values and Confucian values in our governance and society. The sad irony is that many of the elderly in our country are living in miserable circumstances.Despite working so hard to build Singapore to the economic success we have today; there is little appreciation for these poor senior citizens. Instead of enjoying retirement; many of them have to pick up scraps from the street and clean up after others. Only one person is credited for all the success we have today and placed on a pedestal.Why are strong Confucian and Asian values like utmost respect for the elderly and reciprocation left out in the process?My take is that the Singapore government only adopts and modifies Asian values where convenient for them such as suppressing freedom of the press and having a single party authoritarian government.I don’t have solutions to this problem but ultimately; as a citizen; I no longer wish to see all the whole wayang “it’s sg50! Let us celebrate the pioneer generation!” campaign or one-off distribution of GST vouchers to win favour.What I hope to see is first recognition that elderly poverty is a key issue that we have to tackle.Followed by more long term initiatives beyond the Pioneer Generation Package which can deliver practical help to the elderly and ensure that these people who contributed to Singapore’s economic success are rewarded.Similarly as citizens; I hope that every one of us can do our part to treat our elderly people in our society with care. Simple things like donating to them; chatting to them; greeting them good morning and of course; speaking up for them when they have no means to.How do you think this problem can be resolved?

(Refer to the Annex for specific cost figures.)E. Rationale for Policy1. To meet the needs of a growing elderly population Housingisabasicneedofseniors;notonlybecauseitprovidesasecureandcomfortable home to age well; but also because it provides a social surrounding for active interaction with others in the community. [5] Given the diverse needs and dynamic changes in health status of seniors; the government should support a comprehensive range of housing options targeted at the elderly; complemented with specialized support services. This policy meets the needs of the elderly while increasing their quality of life.2. Integration of facilities There is currently a lack of an integrated approach in providing for the needs of the elderly. Theelderlypopulationisdispersedacrossalargegeographicalarea;afairdistancefrom facilitiesprovidingessentialservicessuchashealthcareaswellasamenitiessuchas communitycentres.Theproposedapproachofaretirementestatewithintegratedhealth; social;andsupportfacilitiesnearbyreducestransportcostsandinconveniencetotheless mobile elderly who have to commute long distances; improving their quality of life.Thispolicyalsoallowsforincreasedefficiencyofserviceproviders;sincethefacilitiesare specializedtoaddresstheneedsoftheelderly;andisincloseproximityofpatrons.More affordable rates can be charged if efficiencies lead to lower unit costs; along with faster and more effective services; especially with regard to healthcare. Due to the high concentration of elderly residents in the estate; demand for relevant services should be sufficient to attract and sustain the operations of the private sector.3. Improved accessibility of health and support services OntopofcurrenthealthcaresubsidiesprovidedbytheMinistryofHealth;theclose proximity of flats to healthcare centres should also encourage pre-emptive care; which should improve their health condition; especially when complemented with active retirement which this policy facilitates.4. Land efficiency Currently; support facilities for the elderly such as day-care centres are built on fixed plots of land; which are limited in scope for expansion to support the growing elderly population. As providedbytheConceptPlanReview2000;mixed-usedevelopmentisaneffectivewayto increaselandefficiency.[6]Therefore;thispolicywilladoptthisapproachbybuilding support facilities on lower levels of void decks; optimizing the use of scarce land.5. Social cohesion The agglomeration of elderly in an estate; together with appropriate common spaces; provides a conducive social surrounding for active interaction between the elderly. Research indicates thatcontactsgainedfromengaginginsocialactivitieshavewell-documentedbenefitsfor health;includinghigherlifeexpectancy[7].Thispromotesactiveandhealthyageing; improving the quality of life for the elderly.Social activities can also be more targeted in outreach as the target audience is not dispersed geographically. A welfare organization; comprising of volunteers from the schools and public will be able to organize dedicated activities for the elderly; which not only allows the elderly toage-in-place;butalsoincreasessocialcohesionbetweentheagegroupsthrough meaningful activities.F.

Mythily@imh.com.sgCopyright: copyrighted  Singapore Medical AssociationThe current study aimed to estimate the overall prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of successful ageing; as defined by Rowe and Kahn; among a national sample of multiethnic adults aged 60 years and older in Singapore.Data from older adults who participated in the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly study was analysed. Successful ageing was defined with five indicators: no major diseases; no disability; high cognitive functioning; high physical functioning; and active engagement with life.The prevalence of successful ageing was 25.4% in this older population. Older adults aged 75–84 years and ≥ 85 years had 0.3 times and 0.1 times the odds of successful ageing; respectively; than those aged 60–74 years. Compared to older adults of Chinese ethnicity; those of Malay (odds ratio [OR] 0.6) and Indian (OR 0.5) ethnicities were less likely to be associated with successful ageing. Older adults with lower education levels; who had no formal education (OR 0.2); some schooling but did not complete primary education (OR 0.4) or only primary education (OR 0.5); had lower odds of ageing successfully than those with tertiary education.Older adults in Singapore tend to have much more active engagement with life as compared to their counterparts from other countries. Further research into this population is needed; both in terms of qualitative research to gain a better understanding of successful ageing from the older adult’s perspective; as well as longitudinal studies that explore behavioural determinants of successful ageing.Rowe and Kahn defined successful ageing as the “avoidance of disease and disability; maintenance of high physical and cognitive function; and sustained engagement in social and productive activities”. Researchers have distinguished successful ageing from ‘usual ageing’; where the latter is characterised by a decline in physical; mental and social functioning.(1)Other variants of the term ‘successful ageing’ have been used to define the phenomenon; such as ‘healthy ageing’;(2) ‘optimal ageing’(3) and ‘productive ageing’.(4) Successful ageing has also been variously defined by other researchers. Pruchno et al put forth a two-factor model of successful ageing that comprises an objective and a subjective component. The objective component included having fewer chronic diseases; ample functional ability and little/no pain; while the subjective component took into consideration the older persons’ own evaluation of how well they were ageing; how successful their ageing experience was and the extent to which they rated their current life as positive.(5) Bowling emphasised the need for a multidimensional model of successful ageing that takes into consideration the respondents’ self-report of health status and quality of life; and advocated the need to balance the biomedical perspective with a psychosocial perspective; and vice versa.(6) Phelan et al similarly concluded that older adults perceive successful ageing as a multidimensional concept that encompasses physical; functional; psychological and social health.(7)While successful ageing has been described quite diversely in the literature; it has also been regarded as a “calculable gold standard of ageing”;(8) and many studies have used this concept to characterise the population of older adults. For instance; McLaughlin et al who used data from the Health and Retirement Study from the United States (US) to establish the prevalence of successful ageing at four time points; reported prevalence rates of 11.9% in 1998 and 2000; 11.0% in 2002; and 10.9% in 2004 among adults aged ≥ 65 years; in accordance with Rowe and Kahn’s definition.(9) Hank used data from respondents aged ≥ 65 years who participated in SHARE (Survey of Health; Ageing and Retirement in Europe); a study that included 14 European countries and Israel; and found that the average prevalence of successful ageing was 8.5%; with significant variation among countries – from 21.1% in Denmark to 3.1% in Spain and 1.6% in Poland.(10) Examining data from the China Health and Retirement Study conducted in adults aged ≥ 60 years; Liu et al estimated a 13.2% prevalence of successful ageing in this population.(11) These studies identified that younger age; male gender; higher education and higher income were associated with successful ageing.Singapore is a multiethnic country located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia. It has a resident population of 3.9 million people; comprising those of Chinese; Malay; Indian and other ethnicities. Singapore’s population has grown older over the years. In 2015; older adults (i.e. aged ≥ 65 years) made up 11.8% of the population.(12) The average life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years and the median age of the resident population rose from 34.0 years in 2000 to 39.6 years in 2015.(12) Data suggests that Singapore will meet the World Health Organization’s criteria for an aged society (14% residents over the age of 65 years) within the next five years.(13)Cultural values play an important role in shaping older adults’ perception of successful ageing. However; few studies have examined their role in ageing or made cross-cultural comparisons in Singapore. Using a qualitative approach; Nagalingam explored the concept of successful ageing and the factors affecting it among older Indian adults in Singapore. Most of the respondents cited health status and the need to keep healthy via exercises and diet control as components of successful ageing. Respondents also identified religiosity; financial resources and social support as some of the other key factors for successful ageing.(14) Using a similar qualitative approach among older adults in Malaysia; Tohit et al identified spirituality; physical health and functioning; peace of mind; financial independence; family and living environment as major themes associated with healthy ageing.(15) Through focus group discussions conducted with Chinese; Indian and Malay older adults; Gwee identified six interrelated themes – physical and cognitive wellbeing; harmonious family relations; meaningful social engagement and network; positive adaptation and emotional wellness; positive spirituality; and sufficient financial resources and autonomy – as important for successful ageing. The author also identified some ethnic differences among the respondents: Chinese and Indian respondents cited health as the most important factor in ageing successfully; while the majority of Malay respondents considered religion to be the most important factor.(16) Using a multidimensional concept of ageing; Ng et al used data from 1;281 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65 years) of Chinese ethnicity; who were largely drawn from the southeast regions of Singapore and were part of the Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Study cohort. They found that 28.6% of respondents met the criteria for successful ageing; which was associated with younger age; female gender; better education; better housing; having religious or spiritual beliefs; physical activities and exercise; and low or no nutritional risk.(17)However; to date; there is no data on successful ageing that includes a representative sample of Singapore’s multiethnic population or uses Rowe and Kahn’s criteria. Such data could help us make cross-cultural comparisons and also provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of successful ageing at a national level. Therefore; the current study aimed to: (a) estimate the overall prevalence of successful ageing; as defined by Rowe and Kahn; among a national sample of multiethnic adults aged ≥ 60 years in Singapore; and (b) establish the sociodemographic correlates of successful ageing in this population.The Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study was a comprehensive; single-phase; cross-sectional national survey that aimed to determine the prevalence of dementia among older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) in Singapore. Respondents were randomly selected using a disproportionate stratified sample design via a national registry that maintains details about sociodemographic correlates; such as age; gender; ethnicity and addresses of all Singapore residents. The sampling frame for the study comprised Singapore residents (including Singapore citizens and permanent residents) aged ≥ 60 years who were living in Singapore at the time of the survey. The sample was inclusive of residents who were in day care centres; nursing homes and institutions at the time of the survey. Older adults attending day care centres were interviewed at their venue of choice; either at their home or day care centre. For respondents who were reported to be living in nursing homes or institutions when their households were approached; the interviewer contacted the nursing home or institution using information provided by the family members and made an appointment with the older person after obtaining the relevant consent(s). The study also included an informant (i.e. a person who knew the respondent best) who was administered specific questionnaires.Sample size estimates were based on establishing the prevalence of dementia using the prevalence estimates of 5.2%; as described in a previous study.(18) A target sample size of 2;500 was estimated to provide sufficient precision to measure the prevalence of dementia in the population. The study was approved by the relevant ethics committees (National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board and SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board); and all respondents and informants provided written informed consent. In situations where the respondents were unable to provide informed consent; written informed consent was obtained from their legally acceptable representative or next of kin. The WiSE study has been described in greater detail in a previous article.(19)Guided by Rowe and Kahn’s conceptualisation;(1) successful ageing was defined as having: (a) no major diseases; (b) no disability in activities of daily living (ADLs); (c) no more than one difficulty with seven measures of physical functioning; (d) a median or higher score on tests of cognitive functioning; and (e) active engagement with life (e.g. work; social or community activities).To identify participants who had no major diseases; participants were asked whether a doctor had ever diagnosed them with any of the conditions in a list of chronic medical conditions that are considered prevalent in Singapore; including diabetes mellitus; heart disease; stroke; cancer and chronic lung disease. A diagnosis of depression was made using the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT).(20) The study used Stage 1 Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT depression syndrome for this analysis.(21) Respondents who did not report any of the above five major chronic physical conditions; or depression; were considered as having met the criterion.Respondents who met the criterion of having no disability did not report difficulty performing any of the following ADLs: dressing; bathing or showering; grooming; eating; using the toilet and performing household activities.Participants were deemed to have high physical functioning if they: (a) had no problem standing for long periods (e.g. half an hour); (b) reported no difficulty in walking a distance of 1 km; (c) described themselves as very or fairly physically active; (d) had a higher-than-median grip strength (20.0 kg); as measured by the JAMAR® Plus+ hydraulic hand dynamometer;(22) (e) were observed to have no problems with fine finger movement (touching the thumb to the four digits sequentially several times); (f) did not show a positive pronator drift (Barre sign); and (g) were not classified as having slow gait (defined as a walking speed of one standard deviation below the age- and gender-specific mean gait of the sample).(23) Although the measures of high physical functioning in our study were not identical to those of other studies;(9-11) they have been used by other researchers as measures of physical functioning for successful ageing.(24)To measure cognitive functioning; a cognitive test battery comprising: (a) the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia;(25) which incorporated the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) animal naming verbal fluency task; and (b) the modified CERAD ten-word list learning task with delayed recall(26) was administered to all participants. This generated the global cognitive score; an item-weighted total score from the cognitive test. Participants could obtain a maximum score of 34. A median (29.7) score or higher denoted high cognitive functioning.Participants were defined as actively engaged with life if they reported: (a) ‘doing any work for pay at the present time’; or ‘participating in any religious; community or social meeting’; OR (b) any one of the following social connections: being married; having ‘good friends living in (their) neighbourhood’; or ‘getting together with… neighbours or friends just to chat’ at least once a week.Sociodemographic data on age; gender; ethnicity; education and income was collected. Height and weight were measured by trained field interviewers. During the measurement; participants wore indoor clothing without shoes; while interviewers used a tape measure and a digital standing scale that was calibrated before every use. Height was measured by asking respondents to stand against a wall with their feet together and their heels; back and back of the head touching the wall. They were then asked to look straight ahead with their chin tucked in. The top of their head was then marked lightly with a pencil; and a tape measure was used to measure the distance from the floor to the mark. Weight was measured by asking respondents to step on the weighing scales and look straight ahead. Interviewers were trained in measuring height and weight accurately as part of their training in study procedures. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using a formula: weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres (kg/m2). Self-reported health status was assessed by asking the respondents: “How do you rate your overall health in the past 30 days?” The answer was further categorised as ‘very good’; ‘good’ and ‘moderate’; versus ‘bad’ and ‘very bad’. To confirm their smoking status; respondents were asked if they ever smoked; and those who replied in the affirmative were asked whether they were still smoking regularly. Those who answered ‘yes’ to the question were classified as current smokers and those who answered ‘no’ were classified as ex-smokers.(27)All the instruments were available in English as well as in Chinese; Malay and Tamil. Interviewers were trained in the ethical aspects of conducting a research study and the administration of instruments over a two-week period. A senior member of the research team assessed each interviewer for proficiency and skills upon completion of the interviewer training. Only interviewers who met the team’s criteria were allowed to continue with the fieldwork. Field observations were conducted throughout the duration of the study. Video recordings of training interviews were made available to the interviewers on their iPads to help them revise the methodology whenever needed. Monthly debriefs were also conducted to identify problem areas and the need for retraining or revision of processes. Well-trained dialect-speaking interviewers also administered the translated questionnaires in Hokkien; Teochew or Cantonese; when needed. The choice of language used in the interview depended on the respondent’s expressed preference.Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS System version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc; Cary; NC; USA). All data analyses were performed using weighted data to adjust for oversampling; and post-stratified for age and ethnicity distributions between the survey sample and the older adult resident population in Singapore. A series of multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the sociodemographic correlates of successful ageing and each individual criterion for successful ageing. Associations between successful ageing and other outcome measures – including overall health; smoking status and BMI; with adjustment for confounding sociodemographic variables such as age; gender; ethnicity; and income and education status – were examined using multiple logistic and linear regression analyses. To account for the effects of complex sample design due to stratification and weighting; standard errors and significance tests were estimated using the Taylor series linearisation method. Multivariate significance was evaluated using the Wald test; based on design-corrected coefficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance was set at the conventional level of p < 0.05; using two-sided tests.A total of 2;565 older adults were finally included in the present study; among whom the prevalence of successful ageing was 25.4%. The percentage of older adults reporting no major diseases; high cognitive functioning; high physical functioning; no disability and active engagement with life was 55.3%; 50.4%; 61.7%; 80.9% and 95.1%; respectively. Table I shows the percentage of older adults that met each successful ageing criterion; according to sociodemographic characteristics. Table II shows the sociodemographic correlates of each successful ageing criterion. Age group; gender; ethnicity; income and education status were significantly associated with the reporting of no major diseases and high physical functioning; age group; ethnicity; income and education status were associated with high cognitive functioning; age group; ethnicity and income status were significantly associated with the reporting of no disability; and age group and income status were significantly associated with active engagement with life.Percentage of older adults who met individual successful ageing criterion; by sociodemographic factor.Sociodemographic correlates of each successful ageing criterion.The sociodemographic correlates of successful ageing were examined using logistic regression analysis and the results are presented in Table III. Older age was less likely to be associated with successful ageing – the odds of ageing successfully for older adults aged 75–84 years and ≥ 85 years were 0.3 times and 0.1 times; respectively; of that for participants aged 60–74 years. Compared to participants of Chinese ethnicity; those of Malay (odds ratio [OR] 0.6) and Indian (OR 0.5) ethnicities were less likely to be associated with successful ageing. Compared to older adults earning below SGD 500 monthly; those earning SGD 500–999 (OR 2.0); SGD 1;000–1;999 (OR 2.1) and ≥ SGD 2;000 (OR 2.4) had higher odds of ageing successfully. Participants with lower education levels; who had no formal education (OR 0.2); some schooling but did not complete primary education (OR 0.4) or only primary education (OR 0.5); had lower odds of ageing successfully; as compared to those who had completed tertiary education. Table IV shows the relationship between successful ageing (and its individual criteria) and other health-related measures. After adjusting for age; gender; ethnicity; income and education status in the multiple logistic regression analysis; participants who reported successful ageing had a lower BMI. We also found that those with no major diseases; high physical functioning and no disability were more likely to report moderate to very good overall health status and a lower BMI. Ex-smokers were less likely to be associated with high physical functioning and active engagement with life; as compared with non-smokers.Sociodemographic correlates of successful ageing.Association between the individual criteria of successful ageing and overall health; smoking status and BMI.Applying the widely used Rowe and Kahn criteria;(1) the current study found a 25.4% prevalence of successful ageing in Singapore; an Asian country comprising multiethnic older adults. Our prevalence rate was higher than the mean value reported across European countries (8.5%) and the highest prevalence rate of successful ageing from Denmark (21.1%).(10) In addition; it was higher than that reported by McLaughlin et al(9) in the US (11.9%) and Liu et al in China (13.2%). However; the studies from the US and Europe were conducted among older adults aged ≥ 65 years; as compared with ≥ 60 years in our cohort. In an effort to make our findings comparable with those of our Western counterparts; we estimated the prevalence of active ageing among those aged ≥ 65 years in our sample; and found a rate of 19.6%; which was still higher than that of the US study; but lower than that of Denmark (21.1%; the country with the highest prevalence of successful ageing) and slightly higher than that of Sweden (17.4%; the country with the second highest prevalence of successful ageing in the European study).(10)In Hank’s study;(10) the percentage of European older adults who reported no major diseases; high cognitive functioning; high physical functioning; no disability and active engagement with life was 51.0%; 67.2%; 69.4%; 85.9% and 42.6%; respectively. The current study used similar criteria for no major diseases; high cognitive functioning (using different instruments) and active engagement with life. Compared with Hank’s study; the percentage of older adults in our study who reported no major diseases is almost similar; while that of the other two criteria showed significant differences. Despite their lower cognitive and physical functioning; older adults in Singapore tended to have much higher active engagement with life. This high level of active engagement in our population could be due to several factors; many of which are either policy or societal driven. While the standard retirement age in Singapore is 62 years; as part of the Retirement and Re-employment Act (revised 2012); employers are required to offer re-employment opportunities until employees reach the age of 67 years.(28) Thus; older adults in Singapore are more likely to be employed as compared to those in other countries.(29) Additionally; Wu and Chan had an interesting hypothesis that the public housing system in Singapore plays a positive role in social interaction in Singapore. They suggested that the built environment of the public housing blocks leads to close physical proximity with neighbours and that these well-equipped urban communities provide social support services for older adults. With easy access to amenities such as libraries; healthcare services; day activity centres and community centres; these individuals are able to form social networks that grow stronger with the length of residence in a particular area.(30) Cross-country comparisons can; therefore; identify differences in specific domains and encourage knowledge transfer; wherein countries can learn from each other and promote best practices to enable older adults to age successfully.In the present study; the prevalence of successful ageing varied according to demographic factors; with lower odds of successful ageing among those with advancing age; lower education and lower income. These findings have been reflected in other studies.(9-11) The negative association between age and successful ageing is not unexpected. Biological ageing is characterised by cellular degeneration; leading to increases in chronic diseases and disability with age;(31;32) along with a decline in cognition; functioning and interactions.(33;34) As for education and income; they may interact with multiple domains and with each other to influence successful ageing. It is possible that older persons with higher income have greater access to health promoting resources and healthcare.(35;36) Those with higher education may possess greater knowledge and skills that enable them to exhibit positive health behaviours related to diet; exercise; self-efficacy and personal control;(37) leading to lower risks of chronic illness and disability. It is also possible that they have higher cognitive functioning; as suggested by the cognitive reserve theory; which may aid in successful ageing.(20)Similar to our study; McLaughlin et al also observed ethnic differences in successful ageing. They reported that non-white people were less likely to age successfully as compared to their white counterparts; although this difference was not significant after adjusting for covariates; and concluded that socioeconomic differences in the two groups may have contributed to the differences in the prevalence of successful ageing.(9) In contrast; the differences in successful ageing in our study persisted despite adjusting for covariates. Our data suggests that the proportion of those reporting no major disease was lower among the Indians; while the proportion of those who met the criterion for high cognitive functioning was lower among those of Indian and Malay ethnicities as compared to the Chinese. These differences were also observed in the adjusted analysis and may have contributed to the lower physical functioning and higher disability levels seen in older adults of Indian and Malay ethnicities as compared to those of Chinese ethnicity; thus resulting in lower rates of successful ageing in these two ethnicities.No major disease; high physical functioning and no disability were significantly associated with self-reported health status of ‘moderate; good or very good’; although high cognitive functioning and active engagement with life criteria were not correlated with this status. Successful ageing showed a trend towards significance in terms of association with ‘moderate; good or very good’ status. Bowling suggested that self-reported health status is an important component of a multidimensional model of ageing;(6) which supports the concept of successful ageing as measured in the current study. Lower BMI was associated with successful ageing as well as no major disease; high physical functioning and no disability. Studies have suggested that obesity is associated with chronic physical conditions;(38) while loss of muscle mass and increased body fat may be associated with disability and even frailty;(39) which may have led to both poorer health and disability among older adults in the current study. Additionally; ex-smokers were less likely to be associated with high physical functioning; it is possible that those who had some health problems had opted to quit smoking; while those with no discernible adverse effects continued to smoke; leading to the lack of association between current smokers and successful ageing for this criteria. The association of low BMI and non-smoking status with successful ageing suggests the presence of modifiable risk factors; which can be targeted earlier in life to promote successful ageing.The current study has certain limitations that should be considered in the interpretation of its findings. First; the response rate of the study was 65.6%; and it is possible that those who chose not to participate were more physically unwell or cognitively impaired than those who participated in the study. Thus the prevalence of successful ageing may have been overestimated. Second; although we did our best to standardise the criteria for successful ageing against three recent studies; we were only partially successful. We used more objective measures as criteria for high physical functioning than the other studies; which may have resulted in differences that limit comparability. Third; the choice of physical conditions was arbitrary; using a different set or a larger number of conditions could have affected the prevalence of successful ageing in the current study. Fourth; as stated in the introduction of this paper; the study was limited by the use of Rowe and Kahn’s criteria;(1) which excluded older adults’ perception of successful ageing. The study also omitted interactions between sociodemographic factors; such as between gender and ageing or between gender and education; which may have provided other unique findings. While previous studies have identified common themes across all ethnicities in Singapore; including physical health and social relationships; the salient role of spirituality/religiosity; which was identified mainly by Indian and Malay older adults; was not explored in the study.(14-16) Lastly; we did not study the effects of other important correlates; such as diet and resilience; and their impact on successful ageing. Future research needs to address some of these gaps; including understanding intercultural differences in the definition of and the factors affecting successful ageing.Ageing is a complex and multifactorial process that involves both primary ageing processes (inevitable deterioration of cellular structure and function independent of disease)(40) and the effects of secondary ageing (resulting from chronic disease and lifestyle behaviours).(41;42) Primary ageing associated with structural and functional deterioration will have an impact on functioning over a lifespan and can lead to disability in older adults. On the other hand; secondary ageing can be prevented or its course modified. Data from the Framingham Heart Study has shown that in middle age; having lower levels of cardiovascular risk factors; including lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels; absence of glucose intolerance and non-smoking status; can predict survival and; importantly; major morbidity-free survival to age 85 years.(43) Studies have also shown that regular exercise can counteract some of the adverse physiological; psychological and cognitive consequences of chronic disease risk factors;(44;45) as well as positively influence them.(46;47) Exercise may also be associated with mental well-being;(48) satisfaction with life and social integration(49;50) – all of which are components of successful ageing.Singapore has taken a proactive approach to encourage successful ageing. The focus is on individual responsibility for health; with the family seen as a major source of support and institutional care regarded as a last resort. However; there is an increasing realisation that seniors; families; communities and the state must all work together to ensure the well-being of older adults.(51) Initiatives such as the ‘Many Helping Hands’ approach encourage the participation of community-based voluntary welfare organisations and grassroots organisations to help in delivering services.(52) To ensure intergenerational bonding and prevent intergenerational tensions; a taskforce was set up to promote ‘grandparenting’ and intergenerational bonding; through encouraging intergenerational initiatives and raising awareness of the benefits of such bonding.(53)Thus; successful ageing can be facilitated by employing intergenerational initiatives such as ‘Many Helping Hands’. Individuals must take responsibility for their health by adopting healthy lifestyles such as healthy dietary habits; avoidance of smoking and regular exercise to prevent secondary ageing and ameliorate the functional decline associated with primary ageing. Families and communities can help in this process by supporting older adults in their adoption of a healthy lifestyle over their lifespan and by assisting them to age in place through providing support and ensuring their continued integration into society.This study was funded by the Ministry of Health; Singapore; and the Singapore Millennium Foundation of the Temasek Trust.1.

http://www.yah.org.sg/,Testimonies from our learners I was inactive in the past; I tend to idle around and getting by from day to day. After I joined YAH!'s Happy 50 programme; I realised my brain starts to get active. My pen starts to move and my mind starts to be creative again! At YAH!; I met a new group of friends who not only share their knowledge with me but also listen attentively to me. Now when I share; somebody will listen; when others share; I will listen; too! It is very important to have such friends who will share your load by listening to your woes.YAH! has created the opportunity for us to improve our communications and to get out of loneliness. I am busy with YAH! activities and find great significance in my participation! Coming to YAH!; has allowed me to gain confidence and encouragement from my friends and that is very valuable to me. I learnt about YAH! by chance through a friend from my singing class. I signed up for the course because I was curious and I wanted to learn. After graduation; I signed up as a Community Health Ambassador. At first; I was driven by the interest to gain knowledge for myself. But the programme gave me the opportunity to engage and interact with stay alone and vulnerable seniors. The programme has sparked my passion for serving and helping those in need. Now; I pay regular home visit to the other seniors and check on their well-being and conduct various outreach activities to benefit seniors in different communities. I always felt a sense of regret about my Primary School education; so when a friend told me about a community college for seniors I was very excited and jumped at the chance. The course taught me about self-confidence and seeing my own potential. The learning environment encouraged us to pursue our passion; interest; as well as built our confidence. Immediately after the course; I signed up for the Computer Class. The teacher was encouraged by my enthusiasm in class and invited me to be a facilitator for the new batch of learners. I also took up additional training to be an effective facilitator and now; I guide new students to pursue their own passion and growth. I was a passive father. At home; I used to wait for my children to talk to me. However; in our family issues discussion during our Happy 50 programme; I realised that I have to actively manage my family relationships. Since then; I started to initiate conversations with my children; sharing things on what I had learnt. My relationship with my family has improved tremendously and I feel closer to my family. YAH! strongly believes in providing access to life-long learning; especially for seniors as it enables them to stay relevant; young; increase their self-confidence and pick up a new interest.We advocate lifelong learning at YAH! as it can instil creativity; enhance adaptability and responsiveness in seniors to handle uncertainty; improved communications with their families and communities as well as manage conflicts. We encourage and support our learners to use what they have learnt and put it into action. This promotes self-efficacy as it helps them to build -up their confidence and allows the learners to pursue meaningful work and activities.Through YAH!’s “can-do” spirit; mutual support from their peers; YAH! learners have been creating the multiplier’s effect; bringing happiness to the community.YAH! believes that when society adopts a creative and proactive approach; we will have the greatest chance of realising the benefits and potential of our ageing population.Every year; YAH! conduct social campaigns with the aim to change the way we think about ageing and to encourage the society to recognise the uniqueness and dignity of every older person. Since 2013; our campaigns have reached over 3;000 members of the public.

https://epochtimes.today/fostering-communication-between-the-youth-and-the-elderly/,Bridging the GapAn Old Person is a Family TreasureSOLVENT – A Communication MethodSubscribe For Latest Updates As our parents and grandparents get older; it’s time we repay them for the selfless devotion and care they have showered us over the years.In 2010; National Family Council (NFC) launched an educational television commercial about filial piety. Titled ‘Father And Son’; the advertisement was part of the “Filial Piety” campaign supported by the former Ministry of Community Development; Youth and Sports (MCYS). It aimed to ‘inspire the young’ and drive in the importance of filial piety; a value that is receding in Singapore’s globalised society.The commercial had a stirring tag line: “How one generation loves; the next generation learns”. Through this campaign; NFC hoped that parents would see the need to set an example for their children; so that today’s youth will care for their parents as they realise they will also inevitably grow old.In a bid to create a society more compassionate towards the elderly; MCYS and NFC’s campaign sought to address another problem – the generation gap between the young and the elderly.As the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in a press conference on Nov 25 last year; families still remain a crucial pillar of physical; emotional and financial support for the elderly.Indeed; many elderly yearn for greater interaction with their grandchildren; so more opportunities should be created for these two generations to bond. A closer relationship between the youth and elderly will alleviate the elderly’s feelings of loneliness; and improve their well-being in their twilight years.But bonding with the elderly is easier said than done. Youths often have a hard time communicating with their grandparents due to a generation gap. Many seniors above 65 years of age had grown up in a very different cultural and social environment. Many of them received little formal education and were brought up in more difficult times that were wanting in wealth and comfort. They held values of the past that may seem antiquated or even downright bewildering to the cosmopolitans of the modern age.As such; the vast differences in value systems held by the young and the old create a pressure for both sides to strip their conversations and interactions down to the most mundane things in life – the lowest common denominator within their experiences.Consequently; youths often find interactions with the elderly bland and banal. But this is usually not because the elderly are inherently boring; but because that is all they choose to say.Hence; even when both generations are proximate in space; they are often far apart in thought. Many youths would rather spend an entire evening surfing the web than commit to a moment of sincere conversation with their grandparents.I conducted an informal survey with some youths in Singapore to find out what they think about the elderly-youth relationship; and their answers are indeed what I have expected.Audrey Lam; a student at Bukit Merah Secondary School; said; “I do feel that youngsters nowadays rarely communicate with their grandparents due to technology advancement. The youngsters will keep on looking at their phones; and hang out with their friends.”“I feel that youngsters nowadays rarely communicate with their grandparents due to a generation gap; we don’t have many things in common to talk about;” said Foo Wenyu; a student at Jurongville Secondary School.Other factors such as deterioration in sight and hearing and memory loss on the part of the elderly can also prevent the youths from communicating with them.This is the case for Lim Zihang; a student at ITE College East. He said; “It takes some time for me to communicate with my grandparents because they can’t hear very well.”For student Xiang Ting; she finds it hard to talk to her grandparents because she does not really speak Hokkien. Language barrier is another hurdle for inter-generational communication in Singapore.“If I don’t have a language barrier with my grandmother; I will talk to her every day;” remarked Chen Shengxi; a student at Jurongville Secondary School.“Maybe they can show more care through actions; like buying food for their grandparents or bringing them out. These things do not require much communication;” voiced Geak Teng; a student.A key to bridging the gap is to appreciate the fact that the inter-generational relationship is not a one-way charity; but a relationship of mutual love and support.The MSF report on ageing families in Singapore noted that elderly persons play a key role in the family. Very often; they are the confidants or caregivers of the family. Their value to the family has not gone unnoticed. In a local study; the majority of respondents surveyed held people positive views on the importance of inter-generational ties and filial values.Filial piety is an important part of traditional Chinese culture. A Chinese saying goes: “An old person is a family treasure” (家有一老，如有一寶). There is also a similar saying in Indian culture;“One should always be grateful for the advice one receives from elders.”Indeed; as the elderly have journeyed through life; their words are not vain beliefs; but hard learnt lessons. Even if their lives are not ideal; or if they are not stellar role models; our seniors are repositories of experiences to learn from. Therefore; youths are advised to seek counsel from or simply sit down for a chat with their grandparents. Doing so will not only benefit them; but it can also bridge the inter-generational gap.“The person I respect most is my grandfather. He is like a treasure to me. He taught me life values. For example; I cannot owe people anything especially favour because it is very difficult to return;” said Geak Teng.Audrey Lam learned from her grandparents to be grateful for what she has. “As my grandparents have gone through the Second World War; they know what life is like under those tough and harsh conditions. This is why they want me to be grateful for what I have; for instance; not wasting my food.”Su Ching; a student at Bukit Merah Secondary; learnt from her grandparents what it means to respect others. “They taught me to treat people nicely; and that I should think of others; like what is good for others; and not just about me.” She added; “The elderly [are treasures] in the family as they know more about life than us.”At the end of the day; the former MCYS has a light-hearted tip to share – for better interactions with grandparents; young people can try SOLVENT – a method of communication.To communicate effectively; one should slow down (S); maintain an open posture (O); lean forward to convey interest (L); lower the pitch and adjust the tone (V); maintain eye contact (E); address the elderly by name (N); and lastly; touch the elderly to express warmth; care and acceptance (T). Besides physical gestures; young people should also learn to listen.“The key issue is time; attention; care and concern;” said then-MCYS Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan; who was the guest-of-honour at the inaugural YO!

https://sg.news.yahoo.com/four-young-singaporeans-trying-older-120526197.html,What to read next When you are older and suddenly face the inability to make mental decisions for yourself; the last thing you would want is to be taken care of in a way that you do not like or want.Four young Singapore undergraduates are trying to turn this around with a new social campaign to get older Singaporeans to tell their loved ones how they would like to be cared for in case they lose such mental capabilities and need to rely on others.The students are final-year undergraduates from Nanyang Technological University’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information; with the school named after one of Singapore’s former presidents.Freda Tan; Esther Chew; Lim Say Hwee and Haikal Latiff came together to embark on this cause as part of their final-year project; and say their passion for the cause came about when one of their team members witnessed an incident where an elderly person lost the ability to make decisions by themselves.“I witnessed the stress my cousin had to go through in deciding what sort of care his father would want after suffering a stroke;” said Haikal to Coconuts Singapore.The campaign called Let’s Talk Care started in January and ends this month; with the students holding roadshows at polyclinics in Singapore to persuade elderly Singaporeans to make care arrangements; known as advance care planning (ACP).A survey that the students conducted among some 200 elderly Singaporeans aged 50 to 64 revealed that more than 67 percent of respondents did not see a need to get ACP done soon.“We understand that the end goal of sharing one’s future care preferences may not be an easy topic to broach;” said Esther.Knowing that having a sensitive conversation with loved ones such as planning for life emergencies can be difficult; the students have developed a workbook in English and Chinese for these elders to write down their care wishes; which can be accessed on their website.The ACP is different from other types of planning in that it only nominates a healthcare “spokesperson” to speak on behalf of you to doctors; and is drafted through a non-legal document that does not need a lawyer to verify it.It differs from an advanced medical directive; where someone gives a doctor the right to stop treatment to prolong their life if death is imminent.It also differs from a lasting power of attorney; where the nominated “spokesperson” also has the right to determine other aspects of that person’s life; such as property or financial aspects.As mentioned on the campaign website: “ACP is not a conversation about death. It is an ongoing discussion about your healthcare preferences.”More information can be found on the campaign’s Facebook page. Kudos to these students for thinking ahead and being active citizens with their cause.This article; These four young Singaporeans are trying to get older people to plan for life emergencies; originally appeared on Coconuts; Asia's leading alternative media company.

In this Issue of the Journal; experienced planners and experts examine the phenomenon of “double-ageing” from different perspectives with a view to devising feasible and sustainable solutions. K.K. Ling and Karen Lee put forward an innovative “double-smart” approach to tackle this problem in Hong Kong. The authors also advocate city-wide contributions from different stakeholders of the community to come up with feasible solutions and suggest that planners have a critical role in this process. Kamiena Wong; Peter Lam and Roger Chan share their insights on the “double-ageing” phenomenon based on experience from Macau; a neighbouring city of Hong Kong. They propose that such problem could be addressed regionally by tapping into the resources in the Greater Bay Area; and locally by more efficient urban renewal policies and measures. Daniel Chun; who is an IT and smart city expert; gauges the extent to which smart city technologies could be deployed to tackle the problem of ageing population in Hong Kong.Ourthreecolumnists;JimmyLeung; AndrewLamandBettyHowriteonthreeinterestingplanningtopics;namely; “Transit-oriented Development in Hong Kong”; “A&A” and “Ageing and the Environment”.StartingfromthisIssue;wehaveincludedanewsectioncalled “Viewpoints”togarnerdiscussionongovernment policies and measures.

The increase in life expectancy means that bulge of the largest age cohort at present; 50-54 year olds; is projected to move upwards to 80-84 by 2044 (see Figure 1).According to 2015-2064 population projections; HongKong’selderlypopulation(65+)will increasefrom15.3%ofthetotalpopulation (1.12millionpeople)in2015to30.6%(2.51 million) in 2043 and 35.9% (2.58 million) in 2064 respectively;puttingmassivepressureonthe alreadygridlockedmedical;socialwelfareand elderlysupportservicessystem.Ifwetake85+ as the benchmark that a certain degree of caring services is almost unavoidable; the cohort would increasealmostfive-foldfrom2.2%in2014to 10.1% in 2064.

Meanwhile;thebuildingstockinHongKongis ageing concurrently with its dwellers. Census statistics not only paints a clear picture ofhowfastourpopulationisageing;italso highlights the need for the society to cope with socialchangesandtheever-changingneedsof its population. According to the 2016 By-census; therewereover152;000“olderpersons”;i.e. elderly aged 65+; living alone; constituting 13.1% of the overall population of “older persons”. The 2016 Census also highlighted that 293;000 (25.2%) are“elderlydoubletons”;i.e.“olderpersons” livingwiththeirspouses(CensusandStatistics Department; 2018). If the “older persons” do not have family members or carers who can assist and care for their daily living; this will increase their demand for LTC. Coupled with the shortage of According to the HK2030+ study; the number of private housing units aged 70 or above was only 1;100in2016;butthisnumberwouldmultiply by 300 times to reach 326;000 in 2046; seriously affectingthequalityoflifeofresidentslivingin the decaying building (PlanD; 2016). If the quality of the ageing housing stock cannot be maintained; upgraded and refreshed in a sustainable and timely manner; this will significantly affect the livelihood of our citizens and the liveability of the city. Hong Kong’s ageing building stock is complicated by two factors: ultra-high building density1 and multiple ownership. The“undividedshares”mechanism2invented byHongKongdevelopersinthe1950shas 1 The Making of Hong Kong: from Vertical to Volumetric (Shelton et al; 2011) discussed comprehensively the building density control problem in the city. The building code before 1956 controlled building density by specifying building height in proportion to street width; permitting a ratio of 2:1. However; as building technology improved and rapid increase in housing demand; the building code changed to allow buildings to rake back a maximum of 76 degrees from the centre line of the abutting street to control their shadow on the street. In some cases; buildings have maximised the plot ratio up to 20.2 Against the convention of selling a building erected on the lot(s) in whole; Hong Kong developers in the 1950s invented the “undivided shares” mechanism where the selling of individual flats within a building to large number of property owners who collectively owned the lot(s) on a pro rata basis. It has since become a common phenomenon that a high-rise high-density building in Hong Kong would include hundreds of small property owners creating a situation of multiple ownership; which in legal terms is known as “stratified titles”.Volume 33; 20195successfullyhelpedtoaddresstheacute housing problem in Hong Kong. However; such developmentpattern;coupledwiththeultra-high building density in 1950s and 1960s3; has also leftthecitywiththefollowingissuesregarding how to improve the functionality and integrity of ageing housing stock:1. Unattractive gain in development potential: Redevelopment of these buildings is usually very costly. A huge effort and lengthy time is required todealwithalargenumberofsmallproperty owners.2. Poor building management and maintenance: The general absence of owners’ corporations may bring about health and safety issues; in particular maintenance; hygiene and building safety issues. 3.Heftyliabilityforpropertyowners:The highrepairandmaintenancecostmayalsobe consideredbymanysmallpropertyownersas unaffordable and/ or not worthy of investment;4.

The problem is most intense inoldurbancores:over70%ofHongKong’s ageing building stock is located within the oldest districts in Hong Kong; namely; Sham Shui Po; Yau TsimMong;KowloonCity;WanChaiandthe Eastern District (PlanD; 2016). ThecomplexityofredevelopingHongKong’s old buildings is highlighted in the Urban Renewal Authority(URA)’son-goingDistrictStudyfor YauMa TeiandMongKok(“YauMongDistrict Study”); which aims to review and develop a new approach and strategy to trigger urban renewal in densely built and heavily populated areas.

More than 800 buildings within the study area lack redevelopment potential as the overall plot ratiohasreachedthepermitteddevelopment capacity (URA; 2017).2. There are about 2;300 buildings with a building life of 30 years+ that have not used up the plot ratioallowance.However;astheyarescattered aroundthe YauMongareaabasketofplanning tools will need to be deployed to create potential for redevelopment (URA; 2019). 3.

Diminishing neighbourhood support: About 60%ofsub-dividedflatswerefoundinthese districts; with Sham Shui Po and Yau Tsim Mong accountingfor40%ofsuchunits(Censusand Statistics Department; 2016). The occurrence of a large number of sub-divided flats will not only bring about building safety issues; it also weakens theneighbourhoodnetworkanddiminishes neighbourhood support.Ageing is a process.

Other than being more technologically literate; our seniors are also becoming more willing and capable to participate in the decision-making process. The data collected from 9;785 questionnaires with the elderly and 739 focus group participants by The Jockey Club Age-friendly City Project5 has helped to develop a solid; evidence-based baseline for the 18 districts to undertake continual improvements to promote an age-friendly city (Jcafc.hk; 2019b).

Moreover; scholars from different disciplines are also increasingly aware of the importance of open space in enhancing social interaction; promoting active ageing6 and reducing mortality amongst our ageing population as part of the frailty prevention and management regime in Hong Kong (Yung et al; 2016; Wang et al; 2017).

This will also contribute towards future-proofing 5 The Jockey Club Age-friendly City Project was developed with three clear objectives; namely: 1. Assess the age-friendliness of each district and build momentum in developing an age-friendly com munity;2. Recommend a framework for districts to undertake continual improvement for the well-being ofsenior citizens; and3. Arouse public awareness and encourage community participation in building an age-friendly cityBesides empowering older adults to champion age-friendly campaigns; the Jockey Club Age-friendly City Project has also funded a total of 84 district-based programmes; involving a total amount of funding of about $16.2 million and more than 74;000 expected number of direct beneficiaries. The study highlights “quick wins” such as how to retrofit or develop maintenance regime for public space and facilities; such as uneven pavement surface and adding non-slip treatment; better lighting; barrier-free access and wayfinding.6 Active ageing is “the process of optimizing opportunities for health; participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age” (WHO; 2002).7 WHO defines Healthy Ageing as “the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age” (WHO; 2015).Volume 33; 20199thecityandmakingHongKongmoreresilient against the effects of “double ageing”.

HKHS has been helping their elderly residents with living space upgrades and has been successful in helping their elderly residents to age-in-place. This model may be scaled-up for elderly singletons and doubletons living in Public Rental Housing to help with their daily living; especially in terms of hazard management andfalldetectiontoreduceinjury and hospitalisation. This should include subsidised orfreeinstallationofhandrailsinbathrooms; upgrade of stove and washing basin with infra-red/ remote sensor to remind the elderly to switch off the appliances and activity-triggered night lights to help elderlies to get out of bed/ go to bathroom at night. These elderly-friendly smart design and technologies are mature and rather inexpensive. Their benefits to the seniors are huge; especially in terms of enhancing their wellbeing and quality of life; without intruding their privacy. Besides hardware; it is also important to explore software approaches to improve the quality of life and wellbeing of our seniors; especially in face of loneliness. Intergenerationalco-livingisonesuchway thatcouldrebuildtheneighbourhoodsupport network of the elderly and increase their sense of self-worth and confidence.

Unpublished presentation to the Council of Asian Shopping Centres (CASC) Conference 2017; October 2017; Hong Kong. The “Five-in-One City Green Space Framework” will perform functions of (1) an unobstructed pedestrian thoroughfare; (2) a part of the open space system; (3) shopping streets; (4) an air ventilation path and (5) a visual corridor. Centrally located public piazza within this framework will become part of the daily walking experience of the residents. The open space network master-planned in the Outline Development Plan for New Development Areas in Kwun Tong North; Fanling North and Tung Chung East are typical examples achieving seamless integration of the five functions. The key to delivering a successful “Five-in-One City Green Space” is the interconnectedness of both public and privately-owned public open space. In connection with the transit-oriented development model; this network of public space could become the centrepoint of socio-economic activities and vastly improve connectivity in the neighbourhood level.17 Ling; 2019. Ling advocates allowing a maximum of 5% GFA exemption in all public housing projects for community facilities provision. This policy would benefit the community in four ways: (1) ensure steady increase in provision of community facilities with the construction of public housing estates; (2) adequate public transport services and public open space are available within public housing estates; (3) NIMBY effect could be minimised as the provision of community facilities is planned ahead of time; and (4) create employment opportunities for elderly residents in public housing.16Planning and DevelopmentConclusionIt is time to recognise double-ageing as the focal issueintheplanningandpolicy-makingagenda; and combine existing; fragmented measures into a holistic strategic framework for the long-term battle ahead.Ageingisnotanewphenomenonofmankind; but longevity is.

The usual disclaimer applies.According to the World Health Organization; the world’s ageing population is expected to continue toriseinthenextfewdecades;duemainlyto falling fertility rates and increase in life expectancy. It is estimated that the number of people aged 65 and above will grow from 524 million in 2010 to nearly 1.5 billion by 2050 with the biggest increase being in developing countries1. Over the past two decades;alongsidewithexponentialeconomic growth;Macaohasalsowitnessedanupward trend in her ageing population; with an increase from 7.5% to 10.55% in the age group of 65 and Table 1 Population of Macao (1997 to 2017)above.The growth of Macao’s ageing population has been at a relatively moderate rate due in part totheinfluxofyoungworkingpopulationto cater for the flourishing tourism industry.

From the statistics published by the Cartography and Cadastre Bureau (see Table 3); the number of residential; commercial and industrial buildings aged 30 years or above has been on the increase inthepasttwodecades. Asshownin Table3; the number of these buildings in 2008 was 3;403 anditsoaredto4;635in2017;representingan average annual growth rate of 3.5%.Table 3 Number of buildings aged 30 years or above in Macao (2008-2017)Number of buildings aged 30 years or aboveAnnual Growth Rate(%)Year2008200920102011201220132014201520162017Source:3;4033;5403;6073;7993;9704;0854;2114;3324;4724;6354.03%1.89%5.32%4.50%2.90%3.08%2.87%3.23%3.64%The Cartography and Cadastre Bureau of MSAR Government; 20187Similar to the population in the city; buildings in Macaoalsosufferfromtheproblemofageing.

Meanwhile; it would appear from the statistics on thebuildingsissuedwithlicenceforoccupation that the increase in the number of buildings aged 30 years or above will peak in 2019; and it may continue to reduce in the years after that.The data from the Statistics and Census Service of Macao shows the number of new buildings issued with the licence for occupation peaked in 1989; after which there was a gradual downward trend.

The number is expected to reach itspeakin2019because1989hadthehighest numberofnewbuildings. Thelimitedavailability ofdatainthepublicdomainmeansthatin-depthanalysisonoldbuildingshasnotbeen possible. Detailed study on the subject is likewise constrained. For example; without information on the number of old buildings in different districts; it is not possible to analyze and study the distribution of old buildings in the city; and the relationship; if any; with the population distribution. Urban renewal in MacaoAsearlyas2006;theMSARGovernment; concernedwiththeemergingproblemof ageingbuildings;hadestablishedtheAdvisory CommitteeonOldDistricts（舊區諮詢委員會）to advise the government on policies relating to redevelopment of old districts. As part of the initiativestorejuvenatetheolddistricts;the government had proposed a scheme for one of the old districts – Iao Hon District（祐漢）. The initialideawastodemolishseveralfive-storey old buildings and then to redevelop the site with high-rise buildings. This; however; was met with a number of difficulties. For example; the law does Number of buildings issued with licence for occupationFigure 1 Number of buildings issued with license for occupation (1980-2017)8 https://www.dsec.gov.mo/TimeSeriesDatabase.aspx?lang=en-US (last accessed on 20 April 2019)Volume 33; 201925not permit redevelopment unless it is agreed to by 100% of the owners. This is virtually impossible to achieve because a number of the owners are nowheretobecontacted;letaloneobtaining theiragreementtoredevelopment. Thescheme was not able to proceed and has been shelved.Figure 2 Streetscape of Iao Han District copyrighted  Peter LamIn2016;theMSARGovernmentreplacedthe AdvisoryCommitteeonOldDistrictswiththe UrbanRenewalCommittee（都市更新委員會）.

Some thoughts on the ageing population and ageing buildings in MacaoAgeingpopulationisaglobaltrendandMacao isnotaloneinthisphenomenon.Likewise;the existenceofageingbuildingsinurbandistricts iscommontomanycities.Aswithother governmentsencounteringtheproblemsof ageing population and ageing buildings; the MSAR Government have to identify measures and draw up plans to tackle them. “The current development of the Greater Bay Area may afford alternative solutions.”Macao has limited resources; especially land and manpower resources; with which the needs of her ageing population can be fully catered for. In this regard; the current development of the Greater Bay Area may afford alternative solutions. Macao should actively explore the possibility of tapping on the resources available in the Greater Bay Area; such as space for residential homes and manpower to meet the healthcare and other services for the elderly population. The latest Policy Address has already alluded to this possibility in encouraging Macaocitizenstolive;aged;workandstudyin theGreaterBay Area.Ontheotherhand;the growing ageing population can be translated into a promising silver hair industry that offers golden opportunitiesintherealmsofresearchesand development; commerce and business in medical and healthcare; residential homes; travel and other services. In this connection; Sun City in Arizona; United States and Yanda International Health City in Beijing are inspiring pioneering examples. With the number of ageing buildings in the city; this is an issue that requires close attention.Among otherthings;thestructuralsafetyoftheold buildings and their ability to withstand typhoons is an area of concern.But finding a solution to theproblemis;bynomeans;straightforward. Considerations will have to be given to rehousing theexistinginhabitantsandactivitiesbefore demolishingtheoldbuildings.Giventhatthe bulk of the urban area of Macao has already been developed; identifying space for new buildings is not altogether feasible. There is an obvious need 26Planning and DevelopmentReferences Internet sourcesChui; Sai On; Policy Address for the Fiscal Year 2019; 15 November 2018; at the Legislative Assembly. https://www.policyaddress.gov.mo/policy/home.php?lang=en TheCartographyandCadastreBureauofMacao; (2018);‘‘Numberofresidential;commercialand industrialbuildingsaged30yearsorabove’’https://www.dscc.gov.mo/ENG/knowledge/geo_statistic.htmlTheStatisticsandCensusServiceofMacao;(2018); “StatisticsDatabase-BuildingswithLicenseofUse Issued(CompletionofBuildings)’’https://www.dsec.gov.mo/TimeSeriesDatabase.aspx?lang=en-USTheStatisticsandCensusServiceofMacao;(2017); “2016中期人口統計詳細結果’’https://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/bfa0112a-eaf3-49a9-9168-b5add46e9d65/C_ICEN_PUB_2016_Y.aspxWhitfield;Richard; “CARINGFOR THEELDERLY– I/II”;MacauDailyTimes;February3andFebruary 24;2016.https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau-matters-caring-for-the-elderly-i.html; https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau-matters-caring-for-the-elderly-ii.html and toprioritisetheformulationofurbanrenewal policies and measures as well as to speed up the legislative and planning processes.

Despite it being a compact city; Macao may see a decrease in the population density when the development ofthe3.5km2reclamationzoneiscompleted. The new reclaimed land will be able to provide residential site for temporary housing for owners affectedbyurbanrenewal. Thismayleadtoa win-win situation. On the one hand;the density oftheolddistrictsmaybereducedduringthe urban renewal process.On the other hand; with residents from old districts moving into the new reclamation area; the pace of development of the areacanbequickened. Atthesametime;the residentscanchoosebetweenremaininginthe new reclamation area and moving back to the old districts; which will have a reduced density after the renewal.With the implementation of urban renewal and the availability of the reclamation land; it is plausible that; in the not too distant future; the problem of ageing buildings will be mitigated.

Besides the government’s push; industry professionals in Hong Kong have also joined forces toformtheSmartCityConsortiumoperating asanon-profitorganizationtoadvocateabout smart city concepts and to promote its benefits to the industry and the general public. The concept of smart city is evolving; it has been widelydiscussedinliteratureforalongtime asnarrativessuchasdigitalcity;intelligentcity; 28Planning and Developmentconnectedcity;sustainablecityandgreencity (NamandPardo;2011;Chourabietal.;2012; Hollands;2008;Caragliu;DeBolandNijkamp.; 2011; Giffinger and Gudrun; 2010). To complicate thematter;therearealsomanydifferenttopic areas making smart cities a very multi-disciplinary topic. While there could be many subject matters worthdiscussingaboutpolicyandtechnologies; for the rest of this article; the focus is placed on the issues relating to aging population and public health care.Aging population in industrialized economiesThe topic of aging population is not new. In fact; asearlyas2003;the TaskForceonPopulation Policy of the HKSAR Government had reported thatHongKongwillsoonseethehugestrain inpublicservicesandalsoincreasingstrainon theyoungergenerationduetoadecreasein birthratesandanincreaseinlifeexpectancy. The change in the population distribution will be significantly different as depicted by the graphical representationstotherightinFigure1and Figure 2 which was based on data collected by the Task Force on Population Policy; and tracked bytheFacultyofMedicineoftheChinese University of Hong Kong. By observing the two graphs;itisnotdifficulttounderstandthatthe city will increasingly have more citizens of aged 55 and above. The capacity; adequacy; reliability and level of services from all our municipal services will have to be increased as a direct result of this changing age demographic.Hong Kong is not alone facing this issue of aging population;andaccordingtothe WorldHealth Organization(2018);between2015and2050; theproportionoftheworld'spopulationover 60yearswillnearlydoublefrom12%to22%.

LeungJimmyC.F.Leungiscurrently AdjunctProfessor;DepartmentofGeographyandResourceManagement;the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Views expressed are his own and do not represent those of the organization in which he is associated with.Transit-orienteddevelopment(TOD)hasbeen hailed as a success in Hong Kong currently with a daily rail patronage of 5.7 million1. The concept has been replicated in other cities notably those in the mainland of China2. There are many papers publishedonHongKong’sTOD3.However;it seems that not much has been written on how TOD comes about in this city and this article is intended to fill this gap.To begin with; what exactly is TOD? C40 Cities describe TOD as “an urban planning principle that high-density;mixedusedevelopmentintegrated witharobustpublictransportsystem.”4The benefitsofTOD includereducingcarbon emissionstoachievingsustainableandliveable cities. 1 Please see https://www.td.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_4937/table21s.pdf2 Topside developments above stations along Line 3; 4; 5 and 6 in Shenzhen are good examples. However; where high-speed rail is involved; it is more appropriate to describe it as “development adjacent to transit”. The ownership and operation of high-speed rails and city rails belong to different levels of government. They are designed and built as different projects. There are no top-side development above high-speed rail stations; for example; Hong Qiao Transport Hub in Shanghai.3 One of the most comprehensive studies on TOD and the Rail + Property Model in Hong Kong is the “Study of Integrated Rail-Property Development Model in Hong Kong” by BS Tang and others; 2004.

Theobjective of the study is “to develop the best solution to Hong Kong’s long-term mass transport problems consistentwithplanninggoals;development plansandalevelofmobilitythatwillallowthe Colony to continue to prosper.” Hong Kong was described as a “topographically unpromising area” and“thelandconsistedlargelyofprecipitous hillsides; but by moving the mountains and filling the sea; usable land has been created.”7The report went on to say; “[T]he maintenance; substantiallyunchanged;ofafarestructure established in 1946; is a major achievement. This hasbeendonewithoutanydirectorindirect subsidy from Government. On the contrary; the companies make substantial royalty payments to Government and at the same time produce profits fortheirshareholders. Anumberoffavourable factors make these results possible. The growing andincreasingmobilepopulationandarapidly expanding economy are the primary factors. The constrictionofthepopulationandemployment intoacompactlandareaisalsoimportant;as isthealmostcompleteabsenceofpronounced peak hours of the day or peak day of the week. All these factors have produced a very high number of passengers per mile of service…”8 (emphasis added)ItisinterestingtonoteaformerChairmanof London Transport Board and a former assistant operating manager of London Transport Railways acted as special consultants to the study bringing withthemexperiencesintheconstructionand operation of underground railway in a city.In the repealed Mass Transit Railway Corporation Ordinance CAP 270 in 1975; section 13(1) states that “[T]he Corporation shall conduct its business according to prudent commercial principles and shallensureasfaraspossiblethat;takingone year with another; its revenue is at least sufficient to meet its expenditures.” (emphasis added) What this means is that the MTRC should rely on the market rather than subsidies from government in the construction and operation of the system.The Hong Kong Long Term Road Study9 completed in 1968 highlighted 3 scenarios:Scenario1–publictransportcontinuedto beprovidedbyconventionalbusesandtrams operated mainly at street levelScenario 2 – rapid-transit system recommended by the Mass Transit Study to be implemented with the first line coming into service in 1974Scenario 3 – sharply reduced level of future car ownership with very high tax; if rapid-transit not providedTheeventualpathofraildevelopmentinHong Kong; which is among cities that exemplify transit systems; is of course history.

There are several precedents for such an approach; the initial phase of development at Tung Chung being anexample.”11(emphasisadded) Thisisaclear planning attempt to achieve TOD.TheThirdComprehensiveTransportStudyin 1999recommendedthepolicywithrailways asthebackboneofHongKong’sfuturepublic transportnetwork.TheTODconceptwas furtherelaborated:“[M]eansshouldbesought to maximize railway usage.

To ensure success of TOD; careful design of the stations and the necessary policybackingintrafficmanagementmeasures are also vital.Post-script: The mass transit system has served Hong Kong well and is acclaimedinternationally. However; therecentconstructionscandalassociatedwith Shatin-Central Link; the delay and overbudget of the high-speed railway and the service disruptions arising from the testing of a new signaling system etc. have compromised the MTRC’s corporate image. Whether this is due to complacency; the change of corporate culture; the partial privatization in 2000; the lack of competition; etc. may warrant a separate study. What needs to be pointed out though is that Hong Kong is not alone in facing such problems. While underground railwaysarehighlyefficientinmovingpeopleand environmentallyfriendly;theyareveryexpensiveto build; operate and maintain.

Meanwhile; we also enjoythelongestlifeexpectancyintheworld; with87yearsforwomenand81formen.In 2011; only about 13% of the total population was aged 65 or above; but it is expected to increase to 30% by 2040.Such substantial changes in our age structure leads to unprecedented demand for elderly-friendly environment in Hong Kong.TheGovernmenthasacleargoalof “ageingin place”; but how to achieve active ageing and fulfill the various needs of the elderly population is a big challenge for our society.Let us look at the three aspects of sustainable development: social; economicandphysicalenvironmentandtheir relationshiptothequalityoflifefortheageing population.As pointed out by Dr. Jackie Kwok (2013); “ageing is not a barrier to active social life.In reality; poverty is the major factor that creates both helpless and hopeless feelings among the elderly people…The most important issue is to make the city life more affordabletoall.”Indeed;thebetter-offelderly peoplewillbeabletoaccesstodifferentkinds of amenities and facilities; travel freely and widely; engage in various social activities and enjoy their retirement lives.For the less fortunate grass-root elderlypeople;theGovernmentshouldprovide adequatesocialinfrastructureincludingsocial 40Planning and Developmentwelfare; social security and supporting facilities to allow they live with dignity.However; these social infrastructures will only support the livelihood of the elderly; but does not mean that they will have active ageing.Ifwewantamoresociallycohesive;socio-spatiallyequitableand inclusivecommunity suitableforactiveageingforall;townplanning isanimportantdriver. Atpresent;planningfor theelderly;toalargeextent;meansplanning accordingtotherequirementsoftheHong KongPlanningStandardsandGuidelines.This is definitely inadequate; as the lists on provision ofopenspaceandcommunityfacilitiesarenot comprehensiveenoughtomeettheirmodern needs; not to mention the quality of provision.The Government and planners should understand and integrate the concern of the elderlies into urban planning and design policies.Planning for elderly facilities should be robust with flexible use which can be in quick response to the population profile in specific districts. In particular; area-based social interventions and inclusive design are required to improve disadvantaged neighbourhoods.toneighbourhood StudiesinHongKongandoverseasfindthatif theelderlypeoplehaveeasyandcomfortable accessibility community facilitiesandwell-designedpublic services/ space;theywillbemorewillingtogooutand getinvolvedinsocialactivities.Indeed;good neighbourhood design has significant influence on activeageingforallelderliesregardlessoftheir socio-economicbackground.Asphysicalliving environmentarerelatedtotheelderly’ssocial; physical and psychological health and well-being; special measures should be adopted to improve the physical and social environments of the elderly in the poor neighbourhoods in old urban areas. The elderly need places to walk; to meet others and to stay active.Local shopping and services; community facilities; adequate and friendly public transportation;pedestrianinfrastructurewith dignified walking environment; public open space withsuitablefacilitiesincludingseatingareas; exercise tracks and corners; shades and greenery as well as toilet facilities should be provided in the neighbourhoods. Inrecentyears;studieshaverevealedthat connection with nature and biophilic design are vitalcomponentstohumanhealthandwell-being.Green spaces have direct health benefits by providing urban residents spaces for physical activitiesandsocialinteractions;andallowing psychological restoration to take place; enhancing well-beingandhappiness.Accordingtothe World Health Organization; green spaces such as parks; sports fields; woods and natural meadows; wetlandsorotherecosystems;representa fundamental component of any urban ecosystem.Whilethegreenandbluespaceprovide environmentalbenefitslikeproducingoxygen; help filtering out harmful air pollution and cooling thecity;theyalsoprovideplacesforwalking; carryingoutphysicalactivity;socialinteraction and recreation; and are important to physical and mental health in reducing health inequalities and improving well-being.In Hong Kong; morning walk is a popular activity amongst elderly people.Morning walks are not limited to doing exercise in the parks; and actually quite a number of elderlies like to have morning hike and walk in the hill.The nature is free for all to enjoy.Thus; having green space near their neighbourhoods and providing safe walking trails with supporting facilities; such as seating areas and toilets as well as some accessible routes; would encourage them to walk more and interact with other people to promote health and active ageing.“Provision of adequate green and blue space for the community is for all and the elderlies should enjoy it just like other members of the community.”In fact; provision of adequate green and blue space forthecommunityisforallandtheelderlies shouldenjoyitjustlikeothermembersofthe community.Intergenerationalopenspaceisa growingtrendworldwide.

Withthebroadagendato minimizeimpactsonthesocialandfiscalcosts aswellasupliftingoverallwell-being;concerted effortsfromdifferentsectorsinourcityare essential to address the pressing ageing problem in the coming 20 years. Town planning; among the variousprofessionsandindustriesassociatedin this policy arena; has a prominent role to play from both strategic and spatial planning perspectives. Buildinganelderly-friendlycitynecessitatesa holistic mindset as well as an overarching planning vision of policy-maker. Hong Kong is committed to edge up the endeavours to promote an inclusive; supportive and liveable city with universal access and sufficient elderly care facilities with the view to promoting active ageing and ageing in place in the latest strategic plan “Hong Kong 2030+: Towards aPlanningVisionandStrategyTranscending 2030”(HK2030+)(DevelopmentBureau;2016). Echoing the above directive; the notion of “Ageing in Place” has been the policy direction to guide relevantstrategiesandmeasureswiththeview toreducingtheinstitutionalizationratethrough promotinghome-basedandneighbourhood-basedcaringservicesupport. Accordingtothe WorldHealthOrganization(WHO)(2007);an elderly-friendlycityshouldpossessattributes ofeightpolicyareas;includingconsiderations tobuiltenvironment;elderlyservicesupport and social participation and inclusion. Whilst the social service and healthcare sector is playing an indispensable role in addressing the fundamental needs of an elderly population; quality of the urban environmentandcommunityfacilitiesprovision; which linked closely with town planning; is equally important.Inthisconnection;theYoungPlannersGroup (YPG)oftheHongKongInstituteofPlanners (HKIP)conductedaresearchonAge-friendly City between February and October 2017; with the objective to explore the current limitations andpossibleplanningresponsestoplan HongKongaheadamidsttheageingtrend (the Study). Built upon the model by WHO; the Study proposed the Age-friendly City Framework asanactionskeletonforplannerstoshapean inclusivecityfortheelderlybasedonitsfive planningperspectives;includingTransportation; OutdoorSpacesandBuildings;Housing; CommunitySupportandHealthServices; andCivicParticipationandEmployment (Figure1).Thefirstthreeperspectivesare keydeterminantsofphysicalenvironmentthat imposesdirectinfluenceonphysicalmobility; health and safety; and ability for continuous social participation;whereasCommunitySupportand HealthServicesisanotherfundamentalpillar underpinning both mental and physical well-being oftheagedcommunity.Townplanningalways places strong attention to the above Age-friendly Volume 33; 201945Figure 1 YPG’s focus on shaping an age-friendly city (modified from WHO’s Global Age-friendly Cities: A Guide; 2007)determinantsthroughvarioustiersofplanning instruments (includingstrategicplan-making; development control and GIC facilities provision); with a vision to foster civic participation among different social groups in the community.Sham Shui Po District was selected as the focus area of this Study given the fact that this district has been one of the neighbourhoods experiencing deeply the issue of ‘double-ageing’ in Hong Kong; i.e.ageingofpeopleandbuildings. Accordingto “ProjectionsofPopulationDistribution2018-2026” (Planning Department; 2018b); more than 20% of the Sham Shui Po District population will be aged over 65 in 2026; approaching to a quarter. It is also revealed that more than 40;000 private housingunitsinthedistrictwillbeagedmore than 70 years by 2046. In this regard; the Study Teamconducteddesktopresearchinterviews; site visits and community workshopduring the 9-monthstudyperiodtocollectrelevantdata from Sham Shui Po District; which is considered asanindicativecaseofreferencevalueforthe othercommunitiesinHongKong. Throughout the research process when the latest version of Chapter 3 – Community Facilities of Hong Kong PlanningStandardsandGuidelines(HKPSG) (Planning Department; 2018a) regarding addition ofrelevantelderlyfacilitiesstandardshadyet toberevised;findingsofthisStudyrevealed theelderly’saccessibilitytoservicesand facilities of their genuine needs and universal designs of indoor and outdoor spaces worth mostdiscussionsamongurbandevelopment professionals.Thefollowingparagraphscover partofthefindingsfromon-siteinterviewand focus group discussion to illustrate some issues observed under the extant planning context.TransportationandWalkability–The Fundamental Urban QualityAccessibilitytosuitablemodeoftransportand associated walking environment has always been acriticalpre-requisitefortheelderlytoobtain anytypeofhealthcareandsocialservices. The Study interviewed some local elderly residing in TaiHang TungEstateatShamShuiPoDistrict tounderstandtheirdailyactivitypattern.From thediscussion;itisnoteworthythatfranchised bus; instead of railway; is the preferred transport modefortheirdailyintra-districtandinter-district travel for social activities and healthcare services. The underlying reason is the “point-to-point”natureofbusservicethatprovidesease of access to people with lower physical abilities. Passengerscouldsimplyaccesstobusstopsin the vicinity of their residence’s entrance; whereas 46Planning and Developmentthenearestrailwaystationexitconnectedto long and steep passage in old districts like Sham ShuiPoandrequiredlongwalkinginsidethe station. Despite the extensive coverage of Mass Transit Railway (MTR) network; the elderly also concerned about the walking environment linking thetransportservicewiththeirresidenceas wellasdestination(e.g.healthcareandsocial serviceonlyavailableinotherdistricts).For instance;oneoftheintervieweesindicatedthat thecancellationofoneofherfrequently-used bus routes from Sham Shui Po to Tsuen Wan had causedinconveniencetoherdailylife;dueto the fact that she needed to spend more time to walk through a longer and steep passage for an alternative bus route which also takes extra time for interchange at Mei Foo (Figure 2). Some may arguedthattherationalizationofbusserviceis the consequence of emphasis of heavy railway as the public transport backbone in current strategic planning regime. While adjustment of bus service provision is subject to a basket of considerations; it is of relevance for planners to rethink how the contemporary transport planning concept could advance and accommodate the genuine needs of the elderly. Figure 2 Steep Passage to the Alternative Bus RoutePlanning beyond Healthcare Service Clusterforhealthcareservice Demand issteadily increasing that; apart from quantity and resources tobeallocated;planningconsiderationscould take a proactive role to achieve a more balanced geographicaldistributionofservice.Underthe imperativeofenhancingprovisionofelderly serviceandfacilities;thePlanningDepartment released the updated HKPSG in December 2018 to include relevant provision standards for elderly facilitiesbyreferringtotherecommendations Figure 3 Ageing in Place Workshopoutlined in the Elderly Services Programme Plan (Elderly Commission; 2017). While the revisions demonstrated the endeavours made by relevant governmentdepartments;includingthePlanning Department and the Social Welfare Department tomarchtowards“AgeinginPlace”;public healthcareservicesprovisionunderthepillar ofCommunitySupportandHealthServicesis anotheressentialaspectdeservingattention.

Nonetheless;thiscouldrenderconsiderable discussions stakeholders (includingbutnotlimitedtopolicymakers; planners;healthcareprofessionals;community concerngroupsandmembersfromdifferent DistrictCouncils).TheGovernmentandlocal non-governmentalorganizations(NGO)could considerflexibleoptionsintheshortrun;such as expanding the use of mobile clinic for certain specialist services.

Communal and open space provide platforms for all walks of life for social interactions and establishing community network. This is of paramount importance to the elderly in their every day life to feel engaged and connectedtothecommunity.TheStudyteam observed in site visits that public housing estates inShamShuiPoprovidedspaciouscommunal spaces for their residents for active and passive recreationalactivities.Somenewpublichousing estatessuchasthenewlycompletedblocks ofShekKipMeiEstateco-locatethetower entranceandelderlyfitnessandrecreational facilitiesatpodium;whichisoneofthemajor passagewaysconnectingtotheneigbhourhood Figure 5 Ease of Access to Communal Spaces(Figure 4 and 5).

As a case in point; seats and facilities are located discretelyatdifferentpocketsofpublicspaces; preventing users from social interactions (Figure 6). To enhance future and existing elderly facilities; plannerscouldpromoteintegratedandflexible designforpublicspacesofnewdevelopment projects during planning and design stage in view ofenhancingsocialinteractiontofacilitatean age-friendly city. For existing neigbourhoods; we encourage planners to engage existing residents and other stakeholders through a district-based engagement mechanism prior to any modification to facilities and design within the communal areas; inordertounderstandandrespondtotheir needs appropriately and effectively.

The policy has four major merits: (1) there would be steady and more sustainable supply of social welfare premises with the progressive completion ofpublichousingdevelopment; (2)public housing development is generally accessible and conveniently served by public transport; and the estates usually have more spacious public spaces to share with users of the social welfare premises; (3) early planning would allow new residents to anticipate the existence of certain types of social welfare premises for easing the NIMBY resistance; and (4) it could create jobs for residents nearby; releasingtheemploymentpotentialofwomen and the retired. This would not only increase their family income but also alleviate labour shortage in elderly homes. The policy could hit several birds with one stone and create a win-win scenario for various parties.In terms of statutory planning; the public housing sitesareusuallyincludedinthe“Residential (GroupA)”(“R(A)”)zones.Accordingtothe MasterScheduleofNotestoStatutoryPlans; “socialwelfarefacility”isregardedasa“use alwayspermitted”underthiszone3.“Social welfare facility” includes social welfare premises for “boys’/girls’ home; residential care home for theelderly;residentialhomeforpeoplewith disabilities;drugtreatmentandrehabilitation centre; halfway house; long stay care home; centre forcommunitysupportservicesforelders; childcarecentre;childrenandyouthcentre; communitycentre;counsellingcentrefordrug abusers;rehabilitationcentreforoffenders;day activitycentre;shelteredworkshop;socialand recreational centre for the disables; etc.”4.Due to the wide ranging uses covered; it would bemorecomplicatedtoincludesocialwelfare premisesinnewpublichousingestatesas compared to incorporating recreational facilities inprivateresidentialredevelopment;especially attheinitialplanningstagewhentheultimate use of the social welfare premises could not be determined. Yet; we could use the elderly caring home requirements as the bench-mark planning anddesignrequirementtomaximisethespatial flexibilityfortheultimateusestobedecided.Itwouldtakeatleasttwotothreeyearsto movefromtheinitialplanningstageofapublic housingdevelopmenttothestageofdetailed technicalassessment;buildingdesign;andthen workscommencement.Duringthisperiod;the concerned social welfare department should have ample time to decide on which types of facilities to be included in the social welfare premises.Withthepolicyofallowingamaximumof5% GFAforsocialwelfarepremises;attheinitial planningstageofpublichousingprojects;the relevantdepartmentswouldnolongerneedto spend time in arguing on whether social welfare facilities should be included.Instead; they could focusonformulatingthemostsuitableplanning and design scheme to accommodate this essential 5% provision even though the exact type of social welfare facilities cannot be determined at the early planning stage of the development project.This is challengingtaskbutIamfullyconfidentofthe expertiseofoururbanplannersandarchitects.As long as we have a lucid policy and set a clear goal; they would certainly be able to accomplish the tasks.The Government would also need to consider the implementation mechanism of this “5%”; whether 3 Town Planning Board (TPB).

201957NIMBY反應，其實是出於心理擔憂多於實質影響。對NIMBY心態要耐心解釋，鼓勵理性交流，可協調改善，但不能無原則退讓。較佳的做法便是在規劃發展較大規模的屋苑時，預留空間容納這類較敏感的設施，並利用設計技巧把這類設施融合在發展總綱圖 (MasterPlan)內。這樣，居民在購買或遷入相關住宅單位前，便已知悉這類設施的存在，而這類設施的處所與居民日常活動空間既有合理分隔，也有巧妙的融合，他們便會較易接受。要做到這個成果，在發展項目的早期規劃階段，便須確定所需設施的種類、規模、特殊設計要求，和該設施在興建階段和操作階段的財政支持。靈活運用「集中」與「分散」空間模式社福服務多數在鄰舍層面及社區層面提供，設施應位於服務使用者或社區人士能夠便捷到達的地點，個別處所的規模未必需要動輒興建一幢獨立建築物。有關設施的配置，應該彈性運用「集中」與「分散」的空間模式。「集中」的空間模式，便是把多項社福設施集中容納在一幢綜合政府服務大樓內。按「一地多用」善用空間資源的原則，服務大樓的設施不可避免要牽涉多個政府部門，多項服務設施。政府產業署往往要協調各部門的政策優次，資源調配的時序，亦要諮詢民意，理順複雜的建築設計要求，過程需時甚久，常被埋怨進度緩慢。這類服務大樓的選址會經過嚴謹的規劃研究，其位置多處於服務人口的地理中心點，有便利的公共交通，附近人流暢旺，一經建成往往成為當區的地標，能為市民提供適切的服務，一般來說也廣受市民歡迎。社福設施也能以「分散」的空間模式容納在社區不同角落的商場、公營和私人屋苑的低層，這可擴大社福設施的整體覆蓋範圍。在城市建成區常欠缺恰當的政府用地，往往便要掌握較大規模的重建項目或政府賣地的機會，在規劃申請或賣地條款中列明提供社福處所的要求，但這要等待項目完成，會有好幾年的時間差。較能在短期取得成果的方法，便是租用或購買現成的物業。財政司司長在2019-20年度財政預算案中公佈預留200億予勞福局和社署購置60個物業，供營辦130多項社福設施，這可見政府解決社福設施不足的決心，值得讚賞與支持。無論是「集中」與「分散」的空間模式，消防安全規定往往成為主要制約，例如根據《幼兒服務規例》，為兩歲以下兒童提供服務的幼兒中心不得距離 地面超過12 米，而為兩歲或以上兒童提供服務的幼兒中心則不得距離地面超過24米；各類長者中心和長者日間護理中心/安老院舍不應距離地面超過24米 1。再加上泊車位和上落客貨位置的要求等，都對不同類型的社福設施選址構成一定限制。「集中」與「分散」空間模式之間並沒有優劣之分，最重要是政府相關部門要有效協調，加強合作，因地制宜，掌握機遇。創造來自公營房屋5%的潛力香港可供發展之用的空間資源，在未來相當長的日子裏都會非常緊絀，而社福設施的供應，特別是因人口急速老化的趨勢，各類院舍都有巨大的供應缺口。我們需要社會創新的思維，尋求突破，發掘可持續的社會資源應對這個艱難的挑戰。首先，讓我們看看現時住宅項目的一些做法。為鼓勵私人住宅發展商向住戶提供康樂設施，例如只供住戶使用的會所、健身室、多用途室等，這些設施的面積可獲豁免計算在總樓面面積內，最多可寬免的面積為住用總樓面面積的5%2。在此政策下，私人住宅發展商大多樂意在屋苑設計上加入康樂設施，這既不影響可出售的總樓面面積，又可以增加對買家的吸收力。從社區規劃的角度來看，此舉不但可增加康樂設施的供應，提升居民的生活質素，亦可透過鄰里之間共享康樂設施，提升社區凝聚力。這項政策已經實施了近20年，相關部門都以謹慎的態度審核每宗豁免個案，不容濫用，因而對城市及物業發展並沒有產生不良影響，堪稱德政。如果私人住宅發展項目在目前的發展管制政1《香港規劃標準與準則》第三章: 社區設施 https://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_tc/tech_doc/hkpsg/full/pdf/ch3.pdf2 Buildings Department PNAP APP-104 Exclusion of Floor Area for Recreation Usehttps://www.bd.gov.hk/doc/en/resources/codes-and-references/practice-notes-and-circular-letters/pnap/APP/APP104.pdfLands Department Practice Note 4/2000(B): Recreational Facilities in Residential Development https://www.landsd.gov.hk/en/legco/lpn.htmBuildings Department; Lands Department and Planning Department Joint Practice Note No.4: Development Control Parameters https://www.landsd.gov.hk/en/legco/jpn.htmPlanning and Development58筆者對我們的城市規劃師和建築師的專業能力滿有信心，只要政策清晰，目標明確，他們一定可以完成任務。政府還要考慮這「5%」的處理辦法，是用發展管制政策豁免計算在總樓面面積內(類似豁免私人住宅項目的附屬康樂設施)，還是根據《城市規劃條例》第16條申請增加這「5%」 (如果法定圖則有對相關的R(A)地盤訂明最高樓面面積的管制)。具體的處理方法可由相關的局、署詳細考慮。最後，政府亦應該作出政策承諾和財政撥備，全面承擔這「5%」引致的額外建築開支，減輕公營屋邨建造機構的財政負擔。總結筆者最近被邀加入香港社會服務聯會的社福設施發展常設委員會，深感社福同工服務大眾，扶助貧弱的熱誠。筆者也對他們因社福處所供應嚴重不足而產生的無奈和焦慮，感同身受。筆者與社福同工的交流中，分享了一些規劃工作的經驗，也從社會創新的角度，提出了上述「5%」的政策建議，希望更能善用撥給公營屋邨的土地資源，較根本地逐步解決社福處所的供應問題，讓社福同工能把他們的專業資源和才幹，聚焦於提供社會服務，減低空間資源不足對他們帶來的困擾和無奈。這「5%」的政策建議，必然會引出大量需要解決的技術、政策、政治考量等難題。但難題不是原地踏步的藉口，反而是尋找解決辦法的動力。在解決問題、克服困難的過程中，我們能以社會創新的實踐，培育破格思維的能力，凝聚迎難而上的決心，讓更多人成為社會創新的行動者。策下，能讓附屬康樂設施取得最多5%總樓面面積豁免，那麼基於公眾利益，政府應不應該考慮制訂政策規定在公營屋邨的總樓面面積上，再加最多5%樓面面積撥作社福設施用途呢？筆者的答案是應該，而且技術上可行。這項政策有四大好處：主要是社福處所會隨著公營房屋陸續落成而有穩定和較大量的持續供應；二是公營屋邨一般都有方便的公共交通服務，屋邨內有比較寬裕的公共空間可以和社福處所的使用者共享；三是及早籌劃，讓新遷入居民預早知道某類社福設施的存在，可減低NIMBY阻力；四是能為屋邨住戶創造就近的工作機會，釋放在家婦女和退休人士的勞動力，既可增加他們的家庭入息，也可舒緩院舍的服務人手短缺。這可以是一舉多得，多方皆贏的政策。在法定規劃層面，公營屋邨的地盤一般會被包括在「住宅用途(甲類)」(“R(A)”)的法定土地用途分區之內，按法定圖則註釋表，在此用途分區內「社會福利設施」是「經常准許的用途」3。而「社會福利設施」則「包括男／女童院、安老院、殘疾人士住宿院舍、戒毒治療及康復中心、中途宿舍、長期護理院、老人社區支援服務中心、幼兒中心、兒童及青年中心、社區中心、濫用藥物者輔導中心、違法者自新服務中心、展能中心、殘疾人士庇護工場、殘疾人士社交及康樂中心等」4等社福處所。因涉及的種類非常廣泛，在新的公營屋邨內容納社福處所，比在私人屋苑內設置康樂設施要複雜得多，特別是在規劃初期，社福處所的最終用途可能仍未能決定。但是，我們能以安老住宿院舍的使用要求作為規劃及設計基準，這便能為最終的決定用途提供最大的空間彈性。一個公營屋邨由初期規劃階段，到進行詳細技術評估、建築設計，再到破土動工，快者往往涉時二、三年。在這時段內，社福部門應有充裕時間，決定該社福處所應用作那一類的社福設施了。有了這個最多5%總樓面面積用作社福處所的政策，在公營屋邨項目的初期規劃階段，相關部門便不用再花時間爭議要不要容納和要容納哪類社福設施，反而可以聚焦為這必定要提供的「5%」 做出最恰當的規劃和設計。3 城市規劃委員會法定圖則註釋總表https://www.info.gov.hk/tpb/tc/forms/master_schedule.html4 城市規劃委員會法定圖則註釋詞彙釋義https://www.info.gov.hk/tpb/tc/forms/dot_revised_broad.htmlVolume 33;

But if you think this is some sort of old folk’s home or hospital; you’re wrong. It’s so much more than that:The Ministry of Health (MoH) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) announced yesterday that Sembawang will host Singapore’s first dementia care village. The location will be at Gibraltar Crescent; near Sembawang Park.The site consists of two land plots; of around 26;350 square metres; and 1;756 square metres. 60 per cent of the maximum Gross Floor Area (GFA) will be set aside for residential use. The rest of it can be used for retail; Food & Beverage; and related healthcare services. The location is very close to Sembawang Park; so that could provide a further amenity for any residents.At this point; you probably realise this isn’t just some home for dementia patients; not with all that retail and dining space. You’d be right.Up till now; concepts of caring for dementia patients have been pretty narrow. They seldom go beyond “we build a facility in an ulu place; and all the patients get put in it till the end”. It makes Changi Prison sound like a charming alternative.Now; however; the concept is to build a community rather than just a facility. Much like how we plan new towns; or “self-contained” business hubs; the dementia care village is an enclave that provides for a lifestyle. This will allow dementia patients to pursue their own activities and preferences: they can go have lunch with friends; shop for clothes; catch a movie (we hope there’s a cinema)…it’s vastly different from traditional institutions; where entertainment means a nurse pushing them around a garden at the allotted hour.Similar dementia care villages already exist abroad; such as in Amsterdam. Medical professionals involved with these projects have said that; when dementia patients are comfortable and active (e.g. shopping for their own clothes and food); it can slow the effects of dementia. It also helps in combating related psychological problems that often accompany dementia; such as depression.Medical professionals will be on hand throughout the village; to assist any dementia patients if it becomes necessary.The village concept has also shown to be helpful to families of the dementia patients – it creates an environment where they can go out for a stroll with the patient; pick out a restaurant with them; go window shopping; etc. There’s no stress in the process; as they know there are professional caregivers within immediate reach.This particular land plot is quite contained; so we don’t see an impact on nearby property prices. But we do feel that; for future developments; these village concepts will be a bit better received by idio…uh; by people who think assisted living facilities will be bad for their property value.It would be nice if HDB gives a proximity grant – or some broadly similar equivalent – to flat buyers who choose to live near parents in such a facility.What do you think of the new dementia care village concept?

Let’s get to 1;500!In the past; there were several easements; private roads and elevators which the residents from Sophia Road; Adis Road; Wilkie Road; and Mt Emily could use to get from Mt Sophia to Orchard Road quickly and easily. It used to take a few minutes to walk from Sophia Road to Dhoby Ghaut MRT and bus station. This is not possible now.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_482_2004-12-27.htmlThese short cuts traditionally enabled residents to avoid the long detour around Mt Sophia. It was necessary for the elderly; pregnant mothers; parents with young children. It also helped students of St Margaret's Primary School and MGS to get to school or get home easily via the Dhoby Ghaut MRT or bus station.However; the easements have all been removed by the new construction developments. There is only a very long and steep staircase at Cathay Cinema available for the residents to regularly use.The other steep staircase at 8@Sophia condo which at one time was open to the public has limited access now; the management will be close it permanently to the public by the end of the year.Both are unsuitable for the daily use of the residents of the housing in this area; especially young mothers with babies and young children and senior citizens. Several people have already fallen and injured themselves using the staircase.Compounding the problem is the increase in the number of residents. The area of Mt Sophia; Mt Emily; Adis Road; and Sophia Road which was formerly occupied by colonial shophouses and private bungalows has recently seen a dramatic population increase due to their replacement by large numbers of condominiums.Unfortunately; there was inadequate provision for efficient pedestrian access for the new residents to Orchard Road. The removal of the easements has made the situation worse. I wrote a few letters regarding the unsuitability of the design of the steep staircase at 8@Sophia and I met with the then Minister for Development who agreed it was a health and safety issue and a short pathway should be considered. The LTA/URA did consider building a public elevator too but the idea got shelved.But without easy walking access to Sophia Road from Handy Road/Orchard Road; it makes life extremely difficult for the elderly; the infirm; mothers with babies and young children. It forces too many people to rely on cars for daily transportation. Parents have to ferry their children to school. Workers have to drive their cars or hail taxis to get to work or take a 15 to 20 minute walk to the bus and MRT stations. The inconvenience increases the level of traffic in this small area.Consequently; the traffic congestion in this area is terrible in the morning and afternoon."Traffic assessment by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) noted that around 600 cars travel to the school daily." Read more at https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/parents-concerns-st-margaret-s-primary-macpherson-move-10538194The staircase currently available is too difficult to use regularly by the elderly; parents with young children and babies. Surely the LTA and URA should do all it can to assist the young families and elderly residents of the area. There is also no loop bus service that services Middle Road connecting Bugis/ Rochor / Bencoolen MRT and Suntec City - this increases the volume of car traffic unnecessarily.To ease the traffic congestion and to assist the many new residents of this area; we ask the LTA/URA to build an easy walking path to link Mt Sophia with Handy Road/Orchard Road. The disused road next to Mt Sophia could be used for this purpose. It is currently overgrown with weeds - it can be linked to the taxi stand area at Plaza Singapura via a pedestrian access.An elevator and underground pedestrian access could also be built between Cathay Residence and Nomu linking Mt Sophia with Handy Road. If security is an issue; access to the pathway and the lift could be restricted by issuing keycards. People have to register (and pay) to obtain a keycard.Please sign and share this petition if you agree and believe a short walking path connecting Mt Sophia to Handy Road is much needed. It is free. The more votes we can get for this petition; the better the chances of its success. 0 have signed.

Retirees may face a gap of years in which they have no income: between theretirementageof52.6yearsand the start of pension payouts at age 65. This is a phase during which the mature-aged could fall through the cracks in the social security system; and be financially unprepared for retirement. According to a 2015 study by the Seoul Metropolitan Government(SMG);manyindividuals over 50 years of age are highly anxious about and unprepared for life after early retirement.29LocalresidentsinSeoulprotestingagainstthe building of rental apartments for young people.While there has been social consensus onprovidingcaretotheelderly;a worseningunemploymentrateforthe younger generation in Seoul; set against a rise in the number of working seniors; has surfaced intergenerational conflict. Assomeseniorsarenotreadyforlife after retirement and are determined to work for as long as their health allows; thereisgrowingcompetitionbetween theseseniorsandyoungerpeoplefor available jobs in the market—the young wantthesamecomfortable;high-paying jobs as seniors do.

(2017)AGE-FRIENDLY CITIESLessons from Seoul and SingaporeSeoul and Singapore are experiencing a demographic shift as their populations age. Over the years; both cities have formulated plans; programmes and policies to support their seniors to live healthily; actively and purposefully as they navigate their daily lives within high-density urban environments. Both Seoul and Singapore share common aspirations to continue building age-friendly cities that support and empower their seniors. Age-Friendly Cities: Lessons from Seoul and Singapore is the third joint research publication between the Centre for Liveable Cities and the Seoul Institute. This publication explores the current and future ageing landscape in Seoul and Singapore and their ongoing efforts to address these issues. Case studies are examined under the themes of ageing-in-place and active ageing to distil common lessons on how cities can be more inclusive for seniors.
https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/positive-ageing-how-can-we-make-it-happen,Introduction: National Engagement with AgeingThe Action Plan for Successful AgeingDealing with DementiaHow Singapore Could Become More Age-Friendly OpinionSurveying current cross-sector efforts; a veteran gerontologist suggests ways to make Singapore an even more age-friendly city.Date Posted28 Jan 2019IssueIssue 20; 28 Jan 2019TopicsSingapore’s approach to the demographic challenges was laid in the 1980s; some two decades after independence in 1965. A number of high-level committees were formed to look at issues related to ageing. These included: the Committee on the Problems of the Aged (1982); the Advisory Council on the Aged (1988–1989); the National Advisory of Council on the Family and the Aged (1989–1998); and the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Health and Care for the Elderly (1997–1999).Building on these foundations; the Ministry of Community Development and Sports released the IMC Report on the Ageing Population and the Eldercare Master Plan (FY2001 to FY2005)1 in 1999 and 2001; respectively. The IMC report was put together through focus groups discussions with various civic society representatives from different ethnic; age; gender; religious; media and union groups.The IMC report proposed 78 recommendations in the areas of Social Integration of the Elderly; Health Care; Financial Security; Employment and Employability; Housing and Land Use Policies; Cohesion and Conflict in an Ageing Society. These recommendations2 aimed to realise a vision of “Successful Ageing for Singapore” as the population ages; and to translate this vision into outcomes for the individual; family; community and nation.The Eldercare Master Plan was put up by the Services Review Committee (SRC); which was formed in 1999 to review then existing services available for the elderly.3 The goal of the SRC was to recommend a blueprint for eldercare services for 2001 to 2005. In continued support of the IMC’s vision for “Successful Ageing for Singapore”; the SRC’s blueprint recommended six areas of programme and service improvements; with a focus on the social integration of older people. These areas included: improving physical infrastructure; the restructuring of funding policies for provision of targeted services by voluntary welfare organisations; programmes for well and frail elderly as well as caregivers; and public engagement and residential care.Building on the work of the IMC and the Ministry of Community; Youth and Sports (MCYS); the Committee on Ageing Issues (CAI)4 released a Report on the Ageing Population in 2006. This report; put together by a tripartite of people-public-private representatives from health; social; manpower and media sectors; speaks of Singapore’s belief that ageing is not just the concern of a specific segment of society but a whole-of-society issue. This is reflected in its recommendations; based on four key thrusts: Housing for Seniors; Accessibility for Seniors; Caring for Seniors; and Opportunities for Seniors.The CAI was succeeded by the Ministerial Committee on Ageing; headed by then Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Mr Lim Boon Heng in 2007. This Committee comprised ministers and senior office holders from a range of government ministries; including: National Development; Social and Family Development; Education; Law; Finance; Transport; Health; Manpower; Culture; Community and Youth; National Security and Defence. The work of the Ministerial Committee of Ageing culminated in the Action Plan for Successful Ageing; announced in August 2015.The Action Plan for Successful Ageing reflects Singapore’s tenets of aged care—ageing-in-place and community-based care—which are founded on the social philosophy of the family and the community as the first and second lines of support respectively. It may be considered Singapore’s response to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) “Global Age-friendly Cities” guidelines;5 and serves Singapore’s unique political; economic and social environment.The Plan outlines three strategic thrusts to make Singapore “A Nation for All Ages”. These thrusts involve the individual (“Opportunities for All Ages”); community (“Kampong for All Ages”); and the nation (“City for All Ages”).“Opportunities for All Ages” focuses on providing opportunities for lifelong employability; lifelong learning; volunteerism; supported by longer healthy life expectancy and financial adequacy.“Kampong for All Ages” focuses on building cohesive intergenerational communities which can support older persons to age-in-place—in which older persons are regarded with love and respect; and in which older persons are supported to stay connected to the communities they live in. Besides these; enhancing legislative frameworks is also another aspect of building a “Kampong for All Ages”. Existing legislation which relates to the protection of older persons; such as the Maintenance of Parents Act and the Mental Capacity Act; is now complemented by a Vulnerable Adults Act. Passed in Parliament in May 2018; the Act will protect individuals 18 years old and above; who due to mental or physical infirmity; disability or incapacity; are unable to protect themselves from abuse; neglect or self-neglect. This Act will allow the Government to intervene to protect vulnerable adults. However; its exercise is viewed as a last resort; as Singapore’s underlying social philosophy is family and community as the main lines of support.The goal of a “City for All Ages” is articulated through the City for All Ages (CFAA) project.6 To date; there are more than 15 CFAA communities across Singapore; the Ministry of Health (MOH) has also published a set of guidelines; “Creating Senior-friendly Communities: Tips and Tools from the City for All Ages Project”; to encourage the growth of such communities. The guidelines recommend that a CFAA should commence with community involvement. To do this; platforms such as a townhall are set up to to bring across the concept of a CFAA to residents in a community. This is followed by dialogue sessions with older residents in the community to understand their concerns and wishes for ageing-in-place; and also presentations from various government agencies on age-friendly programmes available in the community. This recommended format takes on a person-centred approach as it starts from community involvement and puts older persons in the centre of the process. The range of programmes available to seniors also gives them a chance to exercise their agency in selecting programmes they enjoy and which best suit them.As the population ages; dementia becomes a significant concern; since age is a risk factor. In 2004; Singapore published a National Dementia Blueprint. This was followed by the 2009 National Dementia Strategy; which was proposed by MOH in consultation with the National Dementia Network of specialists in dementia care and family physicians.In the 2009 National Dementia Strategy; dementia prevalence was projected to increase from 4% to 5.8% in 2030. This translates to 48;000 to 70;000 persons in 2030; of which 19;000 to 28;000 are estimated to have mild dementia and 29;000 to 42;000 are estimated to have moderate or severe dementia. The Strategy made recommendations in dementia care in the areas of primary prevention; increasing awareness and early detection of dementia; early diagnosis of dementia and comprehensive evaluation of dementia; management of dementia; collaborative model of care; audit and standards of care; as well as training; education and research.While the 2009 National Dementia Strategy7 drives the public agenda on dementia; a noteworthy people/private driver of dementia concerns is the “Forget Us Not” or FUN campaign; an initiative led by the Lien Foundation; a privately funded philanthropic organisation.The campaign seeks to create dementia-friendly communities (DFC) across Singapore;8 through a network of Dementia Friends who may include individuals; businesses; schools; places of worship and services. These Friends are trained to understand dementia and are equipped with the skills and knowledge to support Persons with Dementia (PwD) as they age-in-place. Since its inception; the FUN campaign has reached 13;500 individuals across 60 organisations in Singapore. Beyond outreach; the campaign has also been able to influence legislation and policies. An example is its work with the Association of Banks in Singapore to identify the legal roadblocks that prevent banks from flagging out vulnerable seniors.A series of seminars organised by “Forget Us Not”; an initiative by the Lien Foundation; Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Alzheimer’s Disease Association. Participants signed up as Dementia Friends to show support for the cause.Source: Photos courtesy of Forget Us NotThe success of policies; legislation; programmes and interventions to enable and empower seniors or Persons with Dementia (PwDs) to live confidently in the community is contingent on an approach which includes the voices of seniors and their care partners in design and implementation. For effective and positive outcomes; seniors—including those who have dementia—need to be advocates in their own right for their cause.To date; there has been no systematic evaluation of the Dementia-Friendly Communities (DFC) to document their impact. Have they really achieved their goals? How many PwDs have been positively influenced by the programme? Are there areas that need improvement? While the FUN campaign has reached/trained around 13;500 individuals across 60 organisations such as banks; transport companies; supermarkets and voluntary welfare organisations; a proper evaluation of the programme would validate its effectiveness and identify gaps or areas for improvement. To encourage good practice and follow-up improvement; it is important to study the social and psychological impact of community programmes. This is the trend in developed countries such as USA and Australia as numbers alone may not tell the whole story.A research evaluation component should be integrated at the planning stage of initiatives such as the DFC effort. A survey could be conducted on awareness and attitudes before a programme begins as well as some time (about one or two years) after the programme has kicked off.9 It is important to involve families of PwDs and the main caregivers in programme planning and implementation; as their views can help shape a more culturally-relevant programme. For instance; personal communication with a staff from FUN conveyed that they have challenges in reaching out to minority communities (such as Malay and Indian participants). This could be a general challenge to bear in mind in future efforts.If we look into the future; what may the experience of being a senior mean to the next few generations? Should we carry on doing more of the same; or should our policies; work practices and social norms be reframed to meet the full implications of the demographic shift in population? As a gerontologist; I think that our policies; services and approach towards solutioning may still be relatively conservative and silo-minded in engaging with the ageing phenomenon. To fully expand the potential of our future generations of seniors; all sectors of society have to break out of traditional thinking about what it means to age. The inter-dependency of our needs—i.e.; physical; social; psychological and spiritual—at the individual level means that society’s solutions also ought to be multidisciplinary.To meet the challenges of limited manpower and the need for efficient delivery of goods and services; the potential of technology and communications will have to be exploited. The separation of older generations into the side stream of society (as the current landscape suggests) will have to be reversed; because they will gradually become mainstream in numbers.10An older workforce is a reality; so enhancing the productivity of seniors is something that must be taken seriously. This may be accomplished through upgrading of knowledge and skills (not only through our SkillsFuture framework but also informal learning opportunities) as well as shifts in mindset away from ageism. The lifelong learning strategy to keep seniors mentally and socially stimulated has already picked up momentum in the last decade. This is one of the main thrusts of the Action Plan for Successful Ageing (2015).11 Opportunities are being promoted for older persons to pursue learning and improve themselves; through formal classroom activity; e.g.; classes for seniors to pursue a passion or interest such as calligraphy and painting.Nor should seniors be regarded as a liability to be compensated for. My own experience in the field bears testimony to the wisdom of older people. Through research interviews and focus group discussions with older persons ranging from 50 to 80 years of age on topics such as retirement; widowhood; family bonds and spirituality; and listening to the ways in which they have coped with adversities and overcome them—I have been amazed by their resilience. Seniors may perceive problems and possibilities that the younger generations (due to their limited life experience) may overlook.Another national strategy would be to make job opportunities in the silver industry more attractive to young people; as well as those who wish to switch careers. Remuneration is not the only method. In many countries; fully subsidised training in eldercare-related sectors; supported by well-structured career pathways; has attracted young adults to join the sector (including long-term care): Japan and Taiwan are good examples (watch a short clip on "The Strengths of Senior Care Models in Taiwan" below). Young adults may have the empathy and compassion to work in the eldercare facilities; but if career pathways are truncated; they are disincentivised. Intergenerational work spaces are healthy and rich environments for both young and senior individuals; most importantly; they nurture a sense of community and ownership for our people.To retain Singapore’s unique heritage and multicultural diversity; greater participation and advocacy by people of all ages and backgrounds is crucial. Policymakers should listen with their hearts. Collectively; there needs to be a social awakening to the importance of all generations working together to make our country a better home; and the world a better place. As dif ferent subgroups in society; be they cultural or generational distinctions; our apparent choices may be different—but human needs are the same and we have common aspirations. If we let this understanding guide our policies and practices; we will stay on the right course to steer through the challenges ahead.In conjunction with Singapore’s 53rd National Day celebration; Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Gerontology students and Alumni; together with community partners St Luke’s Eldercare Ltd and Singapore Amalgamated Services Co-Operative (SASCO) and student volunteers from Central ITE Polytechnic; recently organised a successful Sports Day at the Singapore Sports Hub for about 150 seniors aged 65 years and above.

All Rights Reserved. What are some of the common health problems we face as we get older? What are the ways to manage these well so that we can enjoy our golden years? Learn more about old age health problems and solutions.   According to the Department of Statistics Singapore; there are around 5.6 million people in Singapore as of 2018. 13.7% of Singaporeans are at the age of 65 and older. Among this age group; 8;7% are between 65—74 years of age; while 5% are aged 75 years and over.A study led by the Institute of Mental Health found that one in 10 people aged 60 and above (almost 82;000 people in 2018) may have dementia. With higher standards of living in our society and an ever improving healthcare system; the life expectancy of Singaporeans has increased from 73 years in 1990 to 82 years in 2012.Our first batch of baby boomers has also reached their retirement age by now. These baby boomers are equipped with a higher literacy rate; armed with higher-skilled jobs and are living a better quality of life. However; living longer may not equate to a healthy and active lifestyle.As we grow older; it is natural to worry about our health as there is a myriad of health problems such as high cholesterol and other long-term health conditions to give pause to.Some common health problems the elderly face include: Modern science and advances in medicine have made it possible for people to live longer with better healthcare services; but it doesn’t mean that older adults can rely solely on modern medicine to stay healthy. It is still essential for us to: As one ages; the likelihood of physical limitations increases. Reduced vision; hearing; body balance; energy level; body agility and/or physical strength may be experienced. As we grow older; our immune systems may also not work as well. Some changes in our heart health and blood vessels also occur with age. In addition; the increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease has also become a leading cause of death and illness in Singapore. This also leads to a further reduction of one’s mobility and ability to function independently in everyday life.With the right strategies and early intervention by an Occupational Therapist; older people with physical limitations can be empowered to live a fulfilling life with active engagement and participation in daily activities.With the impending silver tsunami; it is essential to ensure that our seniors remain in the pink of health and continue their active lifestyles by engaging in regular physical activity. Thus; promoting independence and keeping the seniors active in the community has become the crucial aims of quality living. Here are some suggestions on how Occupational Therapists can empower seniors with physical limitations to be actively participating in daily activities happily and with great ease:Related:Go Gardening to Keep Dementia at BayIn order to help our seniors remain physically active and independent; it is essential to make healthy changes in one’s daily life. This includes planning each day with a focus on completing tasks of a higher priority. This helps them retain a strong sense of control in their lives.In our busy world; there are often too many things to accomplish within the limits of a day. Time should be set aside; to list the tasks one wants to achieve and prioritise them accordingly. This helps to reduce mental stress as well as celebrate the accomplishment. For instance; important tasks should be completed early in the morning; when one’s energy is at a prime level. This is followed by less important tasks. Incorporating frequent breaks in the daily schedule also helps to ensure that energy levels go a long way.Related:You Can Age WellThere are many ways to encourage seniors with physical limitations to engage in daily activities.Using built-up handles or universal cuffs on eating utensils can help those with grip difficulty feed themselves. Items such as the long-handled sponge; buttoner and shoehorn can be used in showering and dressing. These equipment allow seniors with trunk or upper limb stiffness to perform daily tasks in a seated position safely.Front-load washing machines and portable low height laundry racks encourage ease of laundry management. Repositioning of microwaves and induction cookers to a lower height also promotes simple meal preparation for seniors in wheelchairs.Related:Home ModificationsWith reduced vision; it is essential that larger fonts are used to help our seniors read better.This includes re-labelling and enlarging the expiry dates on food items and medication; as well as using phones or light switches with enlarged numbers or buttons. The use of magnifiers can help them with reading newspapers and other labels.Good lighting throughout the house; such as night lights along the stairways; bedrooms and toilets allow our loved ones to move safely and independently through their living spaces. Appropriate use of contrast; such as highlighting the edges of kerbs and steps with fluorescent tape or paint; can also heighten their awareness of possible hazards.Falls may threaten the health and independence of seniors. Hence; creating a safe living environment can enhance their ability to remain independent.To reduce accidental falls; we can remove clutter around the house; as well as rearrange furniture to widen walkways. Loose wires and cables should be tied or taped to the wall or floor.Consider placing non-slip mats in wet areas around the home; installing grab bars in toilets; and using shower chairs or bedside commodes; to enhance the safety of seniors with physical limitations.Through the appropriate use of suitable adaptive equipment; we can greatly reduce the risk of falls at home.Related:Falls Awareness and Prevention ProgrammeKeeping an open mind to exploring new and meaningful activities can create a positive impact on our senior’s physical and mental well-being.Encourage them to learn a new skill or pick up a new leisure activity such as granny ballet; folk dance; calligraphy or even tea appreciation. Studies have shown that continuous and lifelong learning helps maintain mental alertness.With the availability of the Internet and social media; seniors can also easily access electronic services; grow their social network and actively participate in new social activities. They can also make new friends and renew their relationships with old ones. This can further strengthen their social network and enhance their quality of life.In conclusion; physical limitations in old age may be inevitable. However; creating successful participation in daily life can enhance their experience of old age and self- confidence. The ideas outlined above are a few of the many other recommendations that can aid in promoting the independence of seniors with physical limitations. Occupational Therapists have a unique professional skill base of holistic assessment and enhancement of an individual’s performance through relevant interventions; consistent with promoting the experience of active and successful ageing.

https://www.healthxchange.sg/news/seniors-resilient-but-many-do-not-exercise, Nine out of 10 senior citizens are hardy enough to live independently; according to a survey of 2;558 old folk in Marine Parade. But almost 400 of them show worrying signs of depression or dementia. A similar number also say they suffered a fall in the preceding 12 months. Worse; more than half of these folk aged 60 and older confess they do not exercise.These findings of a Health Ministry survey; done between March and June this year; were unveiled last night at a dialogue Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong had with residents. His Marine Parade constituency has been picked to be the test bed for finding the types of facilities and services that can be introduced to tackle the problems highlighted by the survey. Said Mr Goh: “This is a very important pilot programme because it’s not just for Marine Parade. It’s for the whole of Singapore. The survey is the first phase of a five-year pilot study to look into how homes and communities need to evolve to help the elderly age graciously. During this period; projects will be introduced in Marine Parade and if proved successful; they will be replicated across Singapore; said Mr Goh. The focus on the old is overdue; he indicated. “As you know; we spend a lot of funds on the young; the middle-aged and the workforce... But my own sense is; we had not paid sufficient attention (to the old) in the past because the population was not yet ageing. There were many programmes; but we did not approach the problem in a comprehensive way.” On the whole; the survey shows the elderly are contented with their lot in life. The majority maintain good relationships with their families and express satisfaction with the facilities and amenities in their estate. Most also enjoy the public transport system and – with the exception of the wheelchair-bound – do not have trouble boarding and alighting buses. But there are problems and some can be solved by making physical changes to their homes and the estate where they live. The study will pick about 500 homes to be retrofitted with elderly-friendly features; such as anti-slip floor tiles and handrails in the bathroom; a gentle ramp to overcome the step at their flats’ entrance door; and larger peepholes for these doors. The cost of the retrofitting will come from funds provided by the Tote Board for the study. Other problems will have to be tackled through better coordination between families; health-care and voluntary welfare organisations in the community as well as the Government – what Mr Goh termed the “social ecosystem”. One example is a club catering to senior citizens living alone (10.6 per cent). It will arrange for volunteers to visit them at least once a week. Also in the pipeline is the setting up of a network of general practitioners in the neighbourhood who will ensure that those with chronic health problems receive the necessary follow-up care. Such solutions will be more challenging than the physical improvements; he noted; saying “the difficult part is building a social ecosystem” which can “generate ideas; the practices; the attitudes to look after an ageing population”. Mr Goh gave his ideas too last night. One is a common practice in Japan where old people hang a cloth of a particular colour outside their homes in the day and take them in at night; so that their neighbours can see they are doing fine. “I am thinking of how we can introduce this in Marine Parade;” he said. The dialogue was attended by Marine Parade residents and grassroots leaders who voiced such concerns as rising medical costs and their overcrowded polyclinic. Minister of State for Health Amy Khor; who was present; said the Government was expanding the list of standard subsidised drugs. On the polyclinic; Mr Goh said the Government was looking at the possibility of building a bigger polyclinic elsewhere in Marine Parade. ​Elgen TohNewsletterYou May Also Like​Nutritional Needs for the Elderly ​Cancer in the Elderly - Doctor Q&A​Elderly Bones and Joints Doctor Q&AHow to Cope with Urinary Incontinence​Urinary Incontinence in the ElderlyDid You Know?TagsOur Contributors
https://www.mnd.gov.sg/mndlink/2019/nov-dec/article2.htm, How can we promote healthy ageing through the better design of our built environment? How can nursing homes evolve to meet the changing needs of our people? These are key topics explored at the latest Urban Lab exhibition “Designing Our Age-Friendly City” organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA); to share ideas and generate more discussions on how to realise a more age-friendly Singapore.Ageing populationOne in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older by the year 2030; compared to one in seven today. More seniors will be living alone as well – approximately 83;000 in 2030 compared to 43;000 now. In view of these projections; URA and various other government agencies have been collaborating with research institutes and design firms to explore possible design solutions to encourage healthy ageing in Singapore.Age-friendly neighbourhoodsOne such collaboration is the “Innovative Planning and Design of Age-Friendly Neighbourhood” multidisciplinary research study led by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The research study investigated three neighbourhoods (Toa Payoh; Hong Kah North and MacPherson) to understand older adults’ day-to-day interactions with the built environment and its effect on their overall physical; social; and mental health.By integrating research and design on healthy ageing at the neighbourhood level; the project sought to develop and deliver context-specific planning and design recommendations to improve the age-friendliness of neighbourhoods in Singapore. For example; seniors living in Hong Kah found sheltered connections between HDB blocks “disconnected”; indicating possible wayfinding difficulties. To address this; architectural firm CPG came up with design ideas to ease navigation; and proposed age-friendly features along the paths to mitigate falls and provide comfort. With more seniors living alone due to a desire for more personal space and independence; there is also an increased risk of social isolation. An age-friendly neighbourhood can create places that encourage seniors to interact with their communities. A good mix of lively and quiet spaces for social interactions; regular exercise; and cognitively stimulating activities can also contribute to seniors’ quality of life and may even delay the onset of dementia.In this regard; architectural firm Tierra Design looked at ways to integrate play elements into existing walkways and open spaces; to create opportunities for incidental cognitive exercise and social activities for seniors in Toa Payoh West. Lekker Architects; which worked on reducing the risk of social isolation among seniors living in MacPherson; came up with the idea of a mobile kopitiam. The premise is to bring familiar settings to HDB void decks; thereby drawing seniors out of their homes to interact with the community.Nursing Homes: Now and FutureAlso on display at the exhibition is the research study “Designing Future-Ready and Sustainable Nursing Homes for Person-Centric Care Models in Communities”. This interdisciplinary project led by the National University of Singapore is a collaboration between geriatric care researchers; industry partners; and agencies. The primary focus of the study is to recommend innovative design typologies for nursing homes that support person-centric care models and are well integrated with their surrounding communities. Key design ideas that surfaced among design firms included introducing flexible bed configurations that respond to future needs and changing demand; creating a supportive living environment that encourages movement and promotes interaction among residents; and incorporating shared spaces such as multi-generational playgrounds and community cafés to encourage interaction with neighbouring communities. “As we plan and shape Singapore for the future; we have to take into account how people’s needs might change as they grow older. Hence; this exhibition is a timely exploration of aspects and strategies that URA can consider; to support people in living healthy and happy lives;” said URA Chief Executive Officer Lim Eng Hwee. The “Designing Our Age-Friendly City” exhibition is on at The URA Centre atrium until 31 December 2019. Explore key highlights of the exhibition by joining one of the community tours led by URA volunteers by visiting www.ura.gov.sg/agefriendlycity.

However; the association between arteriosclerosis of the ascending aorta and neurologic dysfunction after coronary artery surgery has not been evaluated prospectively.We examined whether varying degrees of arteriosclerosis in the ascending aorta; assessed by epiaortic ultrasonography; increased the incidence of neuropsychologic dysfunction and stroke in 463 elderly patients (> or = 60 years old) after coronary artery surgery.Patients with severe arteriosclerosis (n = 76) had higher rates of postoperative neuropsychologic dysfunction (26%) and intraoperative stroke (10.5%); the moderately atherosclerotic patients (n = 57) had rates of 7% and 1.8%; respectively; whereas control patients (almost normal or mild arteriosclerosis; n = 330) had rates of 8% and 1.2%; respectively (all p < 0.001). Univariate analysis indicated that multiple small infarctions or broad infarctions; cerebral arterial stenosis; circulatory arrest; maximal thickness of intima around the site of aortic manipulation; and deformities due to clamp or cannulation were associated significantly with intraoperative strokes in patients with severe arteriosclerosis.Severe arteriosclerosis of the ascending aorta significantly increased the risk of postoperative neuropsychologic dysfunction and stroke after coronary artery bypass grafting. If a thick plaque is noted near the manipulation site; a nontouch method of the ascending aorta should be applied to reduce the incidence of neurologic dysfunction.National Center forBiotechnology Information; U.S. National Library of Medicine8600 Rockville Pike; BethesdaMD; 20894USA

https://www.pacificprime.sg/blog/singaporeans-struggle-skyrocketing-medical-costs/,Population aging in SingaporeWhat is the Singaporean government doing to address the rapidly aging population?Addressing rising medical costs with the best health insurance in Singapore Press enter to see results or esc to cancel.Singaporeans are living longer; but are struggling with hiking medical costs and health insurance inflation. The UN estimates that by 2035; 26% of Singaporeans will be over the age of 65 – more than double the 2015 figure of 11.7%. This finding; plus the fact that the fertility rate in Singapore stands at just 1.16; illustrates the importance of chronic illness prevention among both the young and elderly population. In this Pacific Prime Singapore article; we take a deeper look at population aging; healthcare; and health insurance for the elderly in Singapore.Singapore’s aging population is rising at a rapid pace; and as such; elderly healthcare support is one of the government’s main priorities; with several key initiatives already having been implemented to address the silver tsunami’s impact on the Lion City’s economy; society; and healthcare system.A recent study published by the Economic Intelligence Unit and commissioned by Prudential; a large insurance company; unveiled several key findings as it pertains to the aging population in Singapore. Interestingly; the whitepaper; titled Healthy for 100? Healthy Care in Singapore; pegs the current average lifespan in the Lion City at 83.1 years – and this is anticipated to increase dramatically.The report posits:“Singapore’s rapid aging will accelerate in the coming 15 years; shifting the country’s disease load. In particular; a greater proportion of people will need to manage one or more chronic diseases.”In order to support increased longevity in the city-state; the report pointed out that people living in Singapore need to be well-supported in terms of their health and healthcare. 49% of respondents in the aforementioned report; however; say they do not feel prepared for the medical expenses of living to 100. This is a legitimate concern; in 2018; Singapore’s medical costs inflated by 10% – 10 times the Singapore economy’s estimated 2018 rate of 1%! Like most other countries; Singapore’s medical inflation has far outpaced general inflation.Globally; as well as in Singapore; there is a notable shift from a “medicalized” model to one that is more social and rehabilitative. In 2018’s budget speech; the Finance Minister announced two key measures that pivot towards this focus:The Singpaorean government has; in fact; already put forth a whole smorgasbord of schemes to support seniors during their golden years; chief among them being the:Such subsidies and grants can be categorized into three major groups: 1) healthcare subsidies; 2) MediShield Life; and 3) day-to-day senior care. Please note that the list above is by no means exhaustive (click here for the full list).These subsidies and schemes indeed make a lot of sense and are laudable – the combination of MediSave; MediShield Life; and Medifund play an important role in addressing rising medical costs. That being said; those without permanent residency status are not afforded access to such healthcare schemes and subsidies. Should this be the case for you; we highly recommend obtaining the best individual health insurance in Singapore for protection against rising medical costs.As we touched upon earlier in this article; rising medical costs is top among the concerns of both young and elderly Singaporeans. This concern is entirely understandable; especially when considering that the average cost of care is projected to increase tenfold in the next 15 years to SGD $51;000 annually for those aged 65 and above – the highest figure in the Asia-Pacific region! Planning ahead by obtaining the right health insurance for elderly is; therefore; paramount to peace of mind.Getting older is a beautiful thing; but it doesn’t change the fact that our retirement years are associated with a higher risk of developing chronic conditions; such as arthritis; digestive issues; and osteoporosis. The elderly are more likely to develop chronic conditions that require ongoing; often expensive medical treatment; this explains why premiums tend to increase quite dramatically the older we get.As we age; our health needs change – and so too should our health insurance cover. For instance; you may find that the limits and benefits of your current Singapore hospitalization insurance plan are no longer sufficient to offset the majority of your treatment costs.Your financial circumstances may also change; and you may no longer find the idea of removing your plan’s deductible unaffordable. It may also be that you are on the lookout for pre-existing condition insurance coverage; and are willing to agree to an extra loading on this particular benefit.To minimize financial risk; a number of private health insurance companies impose maximum age limits on plans. This means that after a certain age – usually 64-69 years old – the policyholder will no longer be able to renew their policy. Not all insurers; however; impose maximum age limits. Another thing to note here as it pertains to age is that some insurers will request a health report as a requirement for anyone aged 65 and over applying for a plan.Obtaining health insurance as early as possible is the most cost-effective option for ensuring you get the best cover at the best price. The reason is clear: any health condition that you develop under your current policy will be regarded by a new insurer as a pre-existing condition; which is one of the most common health insurance exclusions.This is not to say it is impossible to obtain pre-existing insurance cover; merely that this option is typically only available from a select number of international health insurance providers (caveats – such as a waiting period or extra premium – will usually apply). It’s also a good idea to ensure that your insurer won’t refuse to renew your policy in light of your claims history; which leads us to our next point – the importance of securing a plan that is guaranteed renewable.The most sustainable way of ensuring you have affordable; consistent insurance coverage as you age is to secure international health insurance. This is not just because they provide coverage without geographical boundaries; but most international plans are also guaranteed renewable. This means the insurer can’t reject the renewal of your policy in light of claims made previously. Other popular features of international health insurance plans include:You’ve likely heard of the popular saying; “You get what you pay for”. Health insurance plans with enticingly low premiums are often too good to be true; and will likely lead to additional costs (e.g. in the form of rejected claims) in the long run. Some of the most common pitfalls of cheap health insurance include:When it comes to reviewing; comparing; and purchasing individual or family health insurance; your best bet is to engage the services of an expert broker; like Pacific Prime Singapore. We have strong relationships with all major insurers in the Lion City and globally; meaning we can help clients negotiate the best rates; as well as offer extra support for renewals; claims; etc. – all at no additional cost vs buying directly from the insurer.

https://www.population.sg/articles/unlocking-the-value-of-the-super-elderly, Singapore switched from an ageing population to an aged one in 19 years; a transition that outpaced most other societies in the world including South Korea and even Japan – the poster child of a greying population.The demographic shift began in 1999. The proportion of residents aged 65 years and older reached 7 per cent; which is labelled an ageing population. By 2017; it doubled to 14 per cent – what the WHO calls an aged society.Today; we are approaching a new phase with a rapidly growing group of elderly – the “super-elderly”. They are seniors aged 75 years and above.In Japan; super-elderly residents already outnumber those aged 65 to 74. By 2025; there will be 50 per cent more of them than their younger counterparts. In Singapore; there are still 1.5 times more aged 65 to 74 than those 75 and above. But more will enter this super senior league soon.This swelling ranks of seniors will pose a challenge to the economy. They are likely to slow the per capita gross domestic product growth by 1.5 percentage points every year until 2060.This growing group; coupled with a low birth rate; also means a greater squeeze on the young who may have to pay more taxes to support the elderly. By 2030; the ratio of working age citizens supporting an elderly aged 65 and above will be 2.4; down from 8.4 in 2000.But the super-elderly also represents a huge opportunity for society. Increasingly; they are staying healthy and productive longer. They tend to have more savings after years of working. They also continue to do what younger adults do – work; travel and stay active – giving rise to a “re-creation” industry where products are redesigned to appeal to this older crowd.Changing healthcareOne of the greatest impact is healthcare; with rising costs and different types of care required due to the changing profile of the elderly.This present cohort of super-elderly is made up of the generation before the country’s baby boomers; the youngest born shortly after the Japanese Occupation. Many grew up poor with little access to education; and do not speak English or Mandarin.They tend to have lower expectations of healthcare; said Mr Christopher Gee; senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS); who has done research on retirement financing and the healthcare costs for an ageing population.“Healthcare for them is largely subsidised and they are happy with B2 ward and below;” he said.But he believes this will change when about 1 million baby boomers; aged 54 to 71; enter the super-elderly demographic group in four years’ time.The baby boomers grew up in more affluent times. This means they; as well as their children who had middle class upbringing; have higher expectations. Many will want to go for B1 wards and above or seek treatment at private clinics; driving healthcare costs up.“The healthcare expenditure of the super-elderly will increase over time. While the Government has some measures to prevent medical cost inflation; the sheer demand will cause the price to rise;” added Mr Gee.In fact; Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat expects healthcare expenditure to go up by at least $3 billion to an annual budget of around $13 billion from 2020; due largely to the growing number of seniors in Singapore.Beyond rising healthcare costs is the need to ramp up new models of long-term care in the community.The truth is: Singaporeans are living longer but their gains in healthy years have not quite matched up. On average; they still spend eight years out of 82 in ill health.In fact; half of those who are healthy at the age of 65 can expect to become severely disabled later in life; according to the Ministry of Health. Among them; three in 10 are expected to live with their disability for more than a decade.“The thing we really need is assisted living facilities;” said Prof Angelique Chan; executive director of the Centre for Ageing Research and Education at Duke-NUS Medical School.“This could include home-based medical services that provide help with medication; vital signs monitoring; activities of daily living; and more social ones that help with daily living like grocery shopping and managing finances.”Currently; there is a gap in the system; she noted. Home-based care has traditionally been provided by non-government organisations (NGOs); which rely heavily on volunteers; and the private sector; whose services are not so affordable for the low-income.On this issue; the Government is moving in the right direction. It launched the integrated HDB development Kampung Admiralty; offering services such as those of a handyman or home medical and nursing care.Other models are being studied; such as shared residences where three to four seniors live together and share common areas. They could also live with their families; with personal or home care services offered.Silvering society offers a silver liningWhile the focus on ageing tends to be rising healthcare costs and the impact of a greying economy; greater attention should also be paid on the benefits of longevity.As more and more seniors are healthy enough to work longer; even beyond the current re-employment age of 67 years old; this means they remain productive longer; consume more; and will boost the economy.This is what researchers have termed the longevity dividend – the economic benefits from slowing the ageing process.  As Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said in a IPS conference early this year: “Living longer does not mean being old for longer. It means staying young for longer. We need to keep fit; keep learning; and keep contributing.”Indeed; as people live longer; mortality rates decline. In some ways; 75 could be the new 65  where 75-year-olds now have the mortality rates of past 65-year-olds. They may not be as feeble and frail as their predecessors.“When we do our simplistic projections; we assume they are dependent; but they may not be;” noted Mr Gee. “Some of the future 75-year-olds will be able to help those in need.”“There will be a huge amount of human capital potential and it will be a shame if we don’t tap that.”To benefit from this longevity dividend means helping people to work longer. This requires companies to review retirement and focus policies on retaining and even re-training older employees for different job roles.This will be a boon to the economy. For instance; calculations for Britain suggest that every one-year increase in working age is a permanent 1 per cent boost to GDP.There will also be a boost for “grey” products and services that cater to seniors; but a more youthful version than before. This is because the growing elderly brigade will still want to continue travelling; exercising and doing the things they enjoyed in their younger days.This presents an opportunity for companies to come up with products like travel tours that are more leisurely paced; gym memberships that require lower commitment; or even online courses that enables the elderly to pursue their passion.Mr Gee added that seniors of the future will also have the benefit of accumulated savings; in the form of their CPF savings and home equity.“I would say amongst the most rapidly ageing populations; Singapore is in a fantastic position because we have these savings and very few liabilities;” he added.Despite the challenges super-elderly residents will pose on the economy and society; this silvering group will also add a golden sparkle by being healthy; active and key contributors to the nation.

This is a natural phenomenon that every human is bound to experience.An aging population occurs when the median age people in the country increased and enters their age of ’60s. Today; in Singapore the aging population becomes the most important issue to think about. It’s become a tough challenge to provide adequate residential and healthcare to elderly people.This is possible that Due to the inadequate allocation of funds and lack of concern towards the elderly person; they will have to beg around for the basic necessities.Singapore has the fastest growing economies in the world and has the lowest birth rate and apparently high rate of aging. Almost 10% of its 5 million populations are above 65 years.The figure will be increased to 25% by 2021. This is such a big problem for the country to worry about. This will affect so many things. A young man would be worried that how he will take care of his elderly parents as well as his family. Women; who are near about getting retirement will be worried about her future.This is the first duty of any country’s government to resolve such critical issues and fulfill the needs and demands of its citizens. Thus; Singapore’s government has to take a step to resolve this aging issue and formulate a policy to counter this problem.Before finding the solution to Singapore’s aging problem it is very important to find out the involvement of stakeholders. By studying the effect of aging on stakeholders we can forecast the solution of negative effects of aging.Will the government of Singapore introduce any policy or scheme for the well-fare of an elderly person?Will infrastructure be able to support the older person?

A major step has to be taken in order to control the situation.Singapore has one of the highest proportions of elderly citizens in the world.Shirking standards of an individual’s healthAs one person getting aged; their health decreases eventually and they will demand healthcare.This will give rise to new industries and businesses involved in healthcare.It is really important that society should provide services that target the aged people. Moreover; the world health organization stated that all elder people do not need healthcare if an older person gets proper care by the society they can live a healthy life.Therefore; in the future with such a low birth rate; Singapore may face a problem in attracting foreign talent into the country.As the number of aging people increased; the demand for health care goods and services will increase. Therefore; the pressure on the government will be increased to provide healthcare services. The monetary cost would increase and that will result in increment tax on the society.Moreover; the birth rate is very low and the dependency rate is high in the country. If the birth rate continues to remain that low; in the future that would increase the rate of dependent individuals. Ultimately; that translates into the heavier burden on working individuals to maintain the economic growth of the country.The elder person influences the major part of society in terms of traditions; culture; values. They are those ones who have made our country and help our country to reach a position where it is today.The hard work they have put in the country is a reason for the success of our country. Therefore; proper care and respect should be given to our elder person. Thus; our government is the primary stakeholder involved in this issue; it has started many government initiatives to solve this aspiring aging population problem. Don't Use Plagiarized Sources.

They always seek to hire young workers because they are youth talent and possess with new technologies and can provide maximum productivity.Additionally; during the recession period; only older workers were topmost among the retrenchment list so this contradicts here and the fact is that only older workers can remain with experience and wisdom. So despite the fact of cost efficiency; organizations have to hire older persons.Singapore has taken so many initiatives and services to provide better health care to the older person not just in the hospitals and clinics but at homes also.For example; the Enhancement for Active seniors program implemented by the government introduced a slip-resistant bathroom and grab installed bars within the flats.The government has recognized the increase ratio in older people will make a negative effect on society and ultimately on the economy. The government is conducting many surveys to gauge the physical and mental health of seniors.Some schemes that the government has initiated are Multi-generation flats; Project Life; Granny Flats; Studio Apartments; barrier-free housing environment.To encourage the older employees to continue working; and to change the mindsets to accept older workers; Singapore’s government is putting many efforts.In 2002 the concept of active aging was developed by the European Commission to ensure the self-sufficiency of older citizens after their retirement.Firstly; our economic growth will slow down. If the statics remains the same the number of young and talented people will be very less and no more MNC’s will remain interested in our country. The lesser the number of working people; the fewer individuals to pay taxes. The government will receive less money the ultimate effect on the economy and growth of our country.Secondly; the older people in the country; the lessen a number of people in the strength and lesser the defensive system of the country. We will have fewer young people to fill the ranks of the army; and fewer physically fit citizens to defend us. Our future and survival will be threatened.If immediate short-term and long-term measures are not taken; we will move backward and will reach a rate of growth similar to what we had many decades ago.Our Recommendation: Hire An Assignment Writer60149 Orders Delivered4.9/5 5 Star Rating4125 Phd ExpertHomework HelpDissertation HelpEssay Writing HelpCase Study HelpLaw Assignment HelpThesis Writing HelpPay To Do AssignmentsFinance Assignment HelpAssignment HelpOUR FEATURESUNIVERSITIESLOCATIONSThe Reference papers provided by the Singapore Assignment Help serve as model and sample papers for students and are not to be submitted as it is.

https://www.stjohneldershome.org.sg/blog/young-old-caring-for-the-old-old,A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul.YOUNG-OLD CARING FOR THE OLD-OLDWant to work with us? “Singapore has transitioned from a young population with high fertility and mortality rates in the 1980s to an aging population characterized by low mortality and below-replacement level fertility rates. This demographic shift has also largely been fuelled by the aging post-war baby boomer generation. In Singapore; the proportion of elderly aged 60 years and older is expected to rise from 16 percent of the population in 2014 to over 30 percent of the population by 2040. Within this cohort; the group aged 80+ is anticipated to increase more than 4 times; from 121;800 in 2014 to 567;500 in 2040.” *Many in the news media has referred to this as the “silver tsunami” in Singapore.  Singapore now faces a challenging demographic future. In the 1970s thru 1980s; Singapore was a young nation powered by the post-war baby boom; a young population and high fertility rates.  Fast forward to now – we have the reverse -- we now have a rapidly aging population and declining fertility rate resulting in a likely 4-times increase in the 80+-years-old by 2040 from 2014.Most traditional demography relies on the young to take care of the old and Singapore is no different.  But by 2040; there will not be enough young persons below 60-years to take care of the increasing aging population and continue to sustain a vibrant economy.  A Singapore study have begun to look at classifying the aging segment into (1) young-old aged between 60-79; and (2) old-old aged 80+.  To ensure that we have enough resources to take care of an aging population means that we must rely on the young-old to take care more of the old-old.  Most families today are already having someone in the 60’s or even 70’s as caregivers to their aged parents in the 80-s or 90’s.  In the next decade; this scenario will become more prevalent and would begin to normalize the role of the young-old as caregivers for the old-old.There is a silver lining to all of this.  The young-old is different from the old-old in terms of education and savings.  Greater savings means they have more resources and options; and will rely less on the government. Education makes the young-old more technologically savvy and is able to navigate and use technology to help them in their caregiving roles.  Unlike the old-old; the young-old are most likely smartphone users and are internet savvy; giving them greater access to medical and caregiving knowledge. Efficiency is important here to reduce the demand for institutional care such as community hospitals and nursing homes; whose resources are often stretched to begin with. The idea of the young-old playing a much bigger role in Singapore is not new as in other developed countries.  In many ways; Singapore is more fortunate because the post-war baby boomers have more savings and better education compared to our ASEAN neighbours.  A lot more study and planning needs to be done in this space.*Projection of Young-Old and Old-Old with Functional Disability: Does Accounting for the Changing Educational Composition of the Elderly Population Make a Difference?

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/gibraltar-crescent-site-for-pilot-dementia-care-village-up-for-tender,SingaporeBranded ContentFollow STThe Straits Times SINGAPORE - Plans have been announced to build a dementia care village in Sembawang; the first of its kind in Singapore.The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Tuesday (July 16) that a site in Gibraltar Crescent has been launched for sale by public tender; as part of efforts to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and broaden the care and residential options available to them.Dementia care villages encourage residents to pursue their own lives as much as possible despite their age and condition; as opposed to nursing homes which have sometimes been criticised for being too institutionalised.One such village is De Hogeweyk in Amsterdam; where patients are encouraged to shop for their daily needs at a supermarket and eat at restaurants.Rather than being confined to a room or a bed; residents there are allowed to wander around the village. They also live with other residents in an apartment and have to manage the household with help from staff .This style of living is said to help slow the rate of decline in dementia patients by discouraging dependency.The MOH and URA said the Gibraltar Crescent village will be specially designed to provide a safe; home-like environment where residents are assisted to live independently.The village is due to provide tailored services and programmes to create meaningful participation and social interaction among its residents.It is also expected to provide better access to supporting services and amenities in the wider community for people with dementia and their families.The village complements the home-based care and dementia daycare services currently available in Singapore."We hope that (it) will offer insights into market demand for such facilities and the community needs of persons with dementia; which will contribute to the development of suitable dementia care models in the future;" the MOH said.The site for the village comes with a 30-year lease; is located near Sembawang Park and comprises a cluster of 10 state bungalows that sits on two land plots. The larger plot is 26;350 sq m; while the other plot is 1;756 sq m.The maximum permissible gross floor area (GFA) is 9;170 sq m; with another 900 sq m for extensions to the 10 existing buildings.The Straits Times understands that the bungalows must remain structurally intact.Zoned as residential; at least 60 per cent of the site's GFA must be used for residential development; while the remaining 40 per cent can be developed for residential use; health and medical care use; shops and restaurants; and/or other ancillary institutional uses.The URA said it will use a concept and price revenue tender for this sale to ensure that the selected concept proposal aligns with the vision of the dementia care village.Tenderers will need to submit their concept proposals and tender prices separately.Concept proposals will be evaluated against criteria such as suitability of the proposed overall model of care for people with dementia and quality of the care programmes and services.Shortlisted concepts will proceed to the second stage of evaluation; which will be based on price only.The tender closes on Nov 19.The village at Gibraltar Crescent is one of several initiatives in recent years aimed at dealing with Singapore's ageing population and the issues that arise from it.On March 7; the Ministry of National Development announced it was working towards the launch of its first assisted living pilot site for public housing in Bukit Batok next year; and was also exploring such retirement housing models for private residential sites.The assisted living model in public housing will see seniors buying a home bundled with customisable care services like housekeeping services and 24/7 emergency support.Senior Minister of State for Health Edwin Tong also announced that MOH will roll out a Caregiver Support Action Plan over the next two years to enhance financial support; flexible work arrangements and respite care options for caregivers.A guideline to set standards of care in assisted living facilities was also launched that month by the Assisted Living Facilities Association; a non-profit organisation that advocates assisted living as a model of care for seniors.In 2017; Singapore's first "retirement kampung"; Kampung Admiralty; opened its doors to its first residents. The site's two HDB blocks house a medical centre; a hawker centre; rooftop vegetable and community gardens; and an active-ageing hub.SPH Digital News / Copyright copyrighted  2020 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ageing-well-with-help-from-the-young,SingaporeProject pairing students with older learners proves a hit in push towards successful ageingBranded ContentFollow STThe Straits Times As Singapore ages; the older folk may lose touch with the younger generation. The opposite holds true too; giving rise to misconceptions of each other.But these are often dispelled at courses organised by the Council for Third Age's (C3A) Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP).Here; students from primary and secondary schools; polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education teach senior citizens various subjects like information technology; social media and photography.Over 6;000 seniors and students have taken part in the programme; which started in 2011.It has been so successful that C3A plans to expand it over the next few years; said Ms Soh Swee Ping; chief executive of the active ageing agency. It is also holding an inaugural conference on positive ageing next month; and has developed a toolkit for seniors to help them discover their interests.It will launch 500 such kits at the conference; said Ms Soh.These plans come as the Government is ramping up plans to get people to age well; amid an ageing population and rising life expectancy.Last month; it announced a $3 billion plan to help Singaporeans age confidently and lead active lives.More details will be released next year. By 2030; it is estimated that 900;000 people; or one-fifth of the population here; will be over 65.More research on ageing issues will also be done to make successful ageing a reality for more people.At The Next Age Institute; a pilot study on care pathways has taken off; and an interim report of the findings is expected around the end of next year.The study will provide insights into care arrangements for older people as they transit from hospital to community or home care; said Associate Professor Corinne Ghoh; co-director of the institute at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.The institute; jointly set up by NUS and Washington University in St Louis in the United States in February; has been contributing to the discussions and new knowledge on active and successful ageing.In November; it will co-organise a symposium that will facilitate discussion on active ageing .At C3A; there is a rising demand for the ILP; said Ms Soh.Seniors are quick to sign up for these courses; in which they may learn how to talk on Skype; use Facebook or do public speaking; she said. They also get to interact with the youth and vice versa.Said Ms Soh: "The youth may think that the seniors are clumsy; stupid; have butterfingers or can't learn.Closing the generation gap"But at the end of the six to eight sessions; they may find that the seniors are not scary."This translates to them interacting more with their grandparents at home."The seniors benefit; too; as they may also have certain preconceptions of young people; said Ms Soh.She said C3A can work with more partners and schools to expand the programme.The ILP could also evolve so that senior folk become the teachers."They can teach dialects or customs. It doesn't matter; as what we want to achieve is the bonding;" says Ms Soh.Associate Professor Reshma Merchant; who heads the general medicine division at National University Hospital; said the inter-generational gap is getting wider and "empathy towards the elderly may decline if this trend continues".Co-locating eldercare and childcare facilities in new Housing Board developments to maximise opportunities for intergenerational interaction is an excellent idea; she said."Most elderly people feel much more valued when surrounded by young kids and; in return; the young ones will learn about culture and tradition;" she added.Ms Soh said that to age well; seniors also need to embrace ageing.The third age is a phase where people may look at life in a more meaningful way. It can start at 50 or even 60 but; typically; people from 50 may begin to view life differently; whereas those who are younger could be focusing on financial stability; she added.C3A hopes to get people to view ageing positively at its inaugural positive ageing conference.Ms Soh said: "Even when we say active ageing; people tend to associate it with the physical aspect."But it also includes the spiritual; financial and intellectual aspect."The toolkit that C3A is set to launch will allow seniors to assess which of these dimensions they are lacking in.Ms Soh said: "There will be a score; which will give a sense of where you are; so that you know what to do next."For example; if your intellectual score is low; you can read a book or go for a course."SPH Digital News / Copyright copyrighted  2020 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

A 2015 study by the Institute of Mental Health found that one in 10 of those aged 60 and above here has dementia. And; according to the Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA); there were almost 82;000 people with dementia in Singapore last year. This number is expected to hit 103;000 in 2030.MOH and URA said the planned village will be specially designed to provide a safe; home-like environment where residents are assisted to live independently.The village will provide tailored services and programmes to create meaningful participation and social interaction among its residents."We hope that (it) will offer insights into market demand for such facilities and the community needs of persons with dementia; which will contribute to the development of suitable dementia care models in the future;" MOH said.The site for the village comes with a 30-year lease. It is located near Sembawang Park and comprises a cluster of 10 state bungalows on two land plots. The larger plot is 26;350 sq m; while the other is 1;756 sq m.The maximum permissible gross floor area (GFA) is 9;170 sq m; with another 900 sq m for extensions to the 10 existing buildings.The Straits Times understands that the bungalows must remain structurally intact.Ms Joan Pereira; an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC and a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health; called the concept of a dementia village "an ideal model of care for persons with dementia" as it encourages independence in a safe environment."Together with other assisted living options; such facilities will reform the way we care for Singaporeans and allow our elderly greater flexibility in choosing how they want to live their golden years;" she said. The village will complement home-based care and dementia daycare services currently available.ADA's chief executive officer Jason Foo backed plans for the village as an alternative to residential care for patients who wish to be more independent.He added that ageing in place is still possible with dementia-friendly communities and an inclusive society."We should give persons with dementia and their caregivers the choice of the best option suited to their needs;" he said.The site set aside for the village is zoned as residential; and at least 60 per cent of its GFA must be used for residential development. The remaining 40 per cent can be developed for residential use; health; medical care and other uses.To pick the most suitable proposal; the URA will get tenderers to submit their concept proposals and tender prices separately.Concept proposals will be evaluated against criteria such as suitability of the proposed overall model of care for people with dementia and quality of the care programmes and services. Shortlisted concepts will go to the second stage of evaluation; which will be based on price only.The tender closes on Nov 19.SPH Digital News / Copyright copyrighted  2020 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

https://www.unscrambled.sg/2020/02/01/how-to-ensure-sustainability-with-an-ageing-population-singapore-is-so-young-but-ageing-so-fast/,What sticky population dilemmas threaten our country’s sustainability?How can Singapore remain sustainable with an ageing population?  TL;DR – The answers are in a white paper published 7 years ago.As a small; densely populated island nation with no natural resources; Singapore’s only resource is its people.However Singapore is currently facing a critical challenge: How do we ensure sustainability with an ageing population that isn’t reproducing fast enough to replace itself?There are currently about 3.5 million citizens in Singapore; 0.53m PRs and 1.68m non-residents. Out of the 1;68m non-residents; about 41% are low-skilled foreign workers. In this group are also over 0.5m foreign domestic workers and construction site workers.Singapore’s population by residency status as at June 2019 (via Department of Statistics) Although the number of marriages seem to be following a trend of increasing over the years; Singapore’s total fertility rate saw a dip from 1.16 in 2017 to 1.14 in 2018. The replacement rate for us to sustain our population is 2.1; almost double our total fertility rate.The replacement level fertility is 2.1; but Singapore’s total fertility rate is 1.14 in 2018.(via)In the last decade; Singapore resident population has grown older with more elderly and fewer younger people.Based on projections from the United Nations (UN); 47% of Singapore’s total population will be aged 65 years or older in 2050.In other words; there are now fewer working-age adults to support each resident aged 65 years and over.As of 2020; 3.8 workers support 1 elderly aged 65 and above. This will shrink to 2.3 in 10 years time.(via)In addition; because we have been having fewer babies; the number of working-age citizens has started to decline since 2015.The number of working-age citizens has passed its peak in 2015. (via)With a shrinking working population; a growing ageing population and facing the unlikelihood of Singaporeans suddenly reproducing like rabbits in our stressful; fast-paced society; how can Singapore sustain itself?This question was actually addressed in the 2013 Population White Paper which was unpopular for its 6.9m target. In fact; if you read through the White Paper; there is a paragraph which says:We need to find a balance. If we do too little to address the demographic challenge; we risk becoming a steadily greying society; losing vitality and verve; with our young people leaving for opportunities elsewhere.But if we take in too many immigrants and foreign workers; we will weaken our national identity and sense of belonging; and feel crowded out of our own home.This White Paper aims for a judicious balance to achieve our goal of: A Sustainable Population for a Dynamic Singapore.A summary of the white paper’s suggestions can be found below:(via) In order for Singapore to continue its journey towards a sustainable nation; it is important to invest in the people in Singapore.Evidently; much been to ensure that Singaporeans can achieve mass education at the primary; secondary; and tertiary levels since the 1960s. The majority of Singapore workers are now PMETs.Today; with the rapid technological advances which will change the nature of work and the skills required in the workforce; an array of initiatives have also been rolled out to help workers to stay relevant and nimble so that workers can move into new jobs and industries; and increase the labour participation rate (such as mature workers; back-to-work women and people with disabilities).In April 2013; the WorkPro scheme was implemented to augment local manpower; foster progressive workplaces and strengthen the Singaporean core of our workplaces.Under this scheme; employers can receive funding grants to support the initiatives in the following areas:​To support the employment of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs); in 2014; a government-funded initiative known as Open Door Programme was launched by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and Workforce Singapore (WSG). This programme aims to encourage employers to hire; train and integrate persons with disabilities by defraying employers’ costs in supporting them.The Dive: Most Singaporeans do not know what Sustainability is about; but our Government doesAlthough the government has been encouraging more Singaporeans to marry and have babies; our poor total fertility rate looks unlikely to improve drastically.Hence part of the suggestions in the Population White Paper for a sustainable Singapore includes being open to immigration; maintaining a stable PR population; and complement our Singaporean core with a foreign workforce.Allowing foreigners to take up the jobs in the workforce that are not being filled will continue to sustain the economy and attract foreign investments; in turn creating more jobs that Singaporeans can fill.EDB’s Chng Kai Fong talks Jedi Masters; Padawans; 15.2b investments and 32;814 jobsAt the same time; bringing in highly-skilled foreign labour would also inject new sources of innovation and entrepreneurship into the economy; and hopefully transfer some of these skills to the citizens too.I worked with “foreign talents” in a tech company. Here’s my experienceHowever; the increase in foreigners has led to a rise in nativism and anti-foreigner sentiment. The Ministry of Manpower has implemented measures such as the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to crack down on companies which discriminate against Singaporeans.

The project brought together multiple partners from different sectors: SUTD; Geriatric Education and Research Institute (GERI); and three architecture firms (CPG; Lekker Architects and Tierra Design); in collaboration with agencies (URA; HDB; BCA; AIC; MOH). The project was novel in scope and approach; as it covered the planning and design process.By integrating research and design on healthy ageing at the neighbourhood level; the project’sgoalwastodevelopanddelivercontext-specificplanninganddesign recommendations on improving the age-friendliness of neighbourhoods in Singapore.

Research findings for Hong Kah North While Hong Kah North consisted of seniors whowere relatively young compared to the other study neighbourhoods; a significantly higher proportion of seniors indicated a high fear of falling.

CPG proposed design ideas for the existing sheltered connections to ease navigation; and with features to mitigate falls and provide comfort.Some of the design ideas were selected and refined for a small-scale prototype in a localisedzone.Today;aroundBlock338;BukitBatokStreet34;apaintedmotif highlightstheshelteredconnections.Theblocknumbersalongthepathhavealso beenenlargedwithcolourcontrastforgreatervisibility.Theinitialon-the-ground respondents’ survey reflected favourable responses.

Around 10 percent of the surveyed participants in a study by SUTD said that they had not ventured outside their homes over the period of one week. An age-friendly neighbourhood can create places that encourage seniors to come out of their homes to interact with their community.

We take a look at ideas shaping our environments and lives.03The next 50 yearsForeword by Ng Lang; chief executive officer; Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)As the SG50 celebrations come to a close; something that we can all take pride in is the remarkable transformation of Singapore in the past 50 years. Singapore today is one of the most competitive economies and is linked to the world through a well-connected aviation hub and one of the largest ports. We are also regularly ranked as one of Asia’s most liveable and greenest cities. We achieved all these through a planning philosophy underscored by the vision; values and ideas of our city’s founding leaders that placed a strong emphasis on people and their quality of life.Our own solutions In the area of urban planning and management; a key approach that has set us apart is the boldness to find and adapt solutions unique to our own circumstance. In 1975; we became the first city in the world to successfully implement a road congestion pricing scheme; and subsequently control car population through the Certificate of Entitlement scheme to avoid the traffic gridlocks experienced by many cities. We applied the same spirit of innovation to devise our own solutions in areas like housing; urban greening and water management. The public housing scheme started in the 1960s has resulted in 80 percent of Singapore’s population residing in vibrant and inclusive housing towns with good quality and attractive living environments. We created a City in a Garden and immersed our city in pervasive greenery. We are probably the most advanced in using urban space as water catchment to supplement our water demand. Starting with the Future of Us exhibition; the government has embarked on a conversation with Singaporeans to envisage the future we want. The outcome of this conversation will provide important In incremental ways; we are already test-bedding inputs to help government agencies and URA formulate our future plans for Singapore. Our urban environment is getting more complex and with it the aspirations and requirements of individuals in our society. Singapore’s future success will depend on our continued ability to innovate in order to meet these needs and offer an attractive liveable environment with economic opportunities to nurture people; ideas and technology.exciting new ideas in new development precincts such as Marina Bay; Jurong Lake District; and the Punggol Eco-Town. This precinct-development approach allows us to integrate solutions across developmental agencies to produce better outcomes. We are planning and designing for better walkability and a car-lite environment; improved public streets and spaces to enhance community bonding; upstream planning and integration of urban systems to optimise resource usage. When we plan a new precinct; our aim is to make it more liveable; inclusive and carbon-friendly than the last one.New paradigmsBut incremental efforts at innovation will not necessarily guarantee success in the long term. We are an island with finite land; and linear efforts to optimise space; for instance; will at some stage reach its limitations. For Singapore to continue to thrive another 50 years; we will have to explore new paradigms to reshape the living environment and rethink the way we live; work and play. Fortunately; the advancement in disruptive technology in a wide range of areas offers new; exciting opportunities. Technological breakthrough in areas like additive manufacturing; robotics and automation are already beginning to transform the nature of manufacturing; and hence how we plan for industrial 04PHOTO CREDITS (CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT):JEREMY HUI; CHAN WAI MENG; JONATHAN CHIANG; TAN CHOON LAI; NG GUAN SHYH05space. Advances in infocomm technologies are facilitating more flexible working arrangements like telecommuting; while advancement in technology such as in self-driving vehicles and big data management will no doubt allow us to reinvent transport and mobility in our compact urban environment. The same technology can also allow us to re-think healthcare delivery; and how to plan for a more active and independent ageing population.We are already making adjustments in our urban plans to take advantage of these anticipated changes. For instance; URA’s Master Plan 2014 will in the long run bring about two fundamental changes that favour the adoption of new paradigms. The first is the acceleration of efforts to create job centres closer to homes. Beyond the job clusters in Tampines Regional Centre; Jurong Lake District and Paya Lebar; a new area of focus is the North Coast Innovation Corridor that spans Woodlands Regional Centre and the Punggol Learning Corridor and Creative Cluster; which will allow more flexibility to use technology to configure future live-work-play-learn requirements. The second key thrust is to move away from the priority accorded to privately-owned cars. A “car-lite” city will be a very different one that prioritises the public realm for people and quality of life.Our futureAs we embark on the next 50 years; these plans shed some light on the direction we are taking in our plans for Singapore’s physical environment. As the plans inevitably need to be accompanied by a change in the way we live and conduct our daily activities; it is important that they continue to be refined and enhanced through public feedback and discourse so that they have broad support. This issue of Skyline speaks to thought leaders on the exciting future possibilities in several fields. I have no doubt their views will contribute to enriching the conversation on the future we want to create together.06PHOTO CREDIT:DANIEL CHEONG07Living largeHow can we continue to enjoy highly liveable environments in future? WOHA and SUTD talk about convenience; equitability; greenery and why planning should be three-dimensional.Writer Joseph Jones Photographer Cheong Yue Han“Liveability is a fuzzy term; but it’s an important consideration for urban planners and architects and will continue to dominate the agenda of urban authorities;” says Professor Thomas Schroepfer; the associate head of Architecture and Sustainable Design at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD); who is studying future urban typologies for enhancing liveability in Singapore; in collaboration with URA; under the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities Future of Cities research project. This encompasses many aspects from socio-economic and environmental factors to accessibility of public spaces; infrastructure; spread and scale of amenities and ease and availability of local transport.Live-work-play-learn-makeSo how can we continue to enjoy quality living environments even with increasing demands and limited resources? Thomas says it’s about doing more with less. He sees the potential for neighbourhoods to offer a greater plurality of amenities and cater for more live-work-play-learn-make uses. People want the convenience of employment; recreation; transport and facilities within easy reach; and this is possible with high-density compact developments. “If you increase the amenities at the same or even greater density than it was before; then high density can become the perfect marriage of a vibrant; busy; highly serviced area; which still has parks and gardens and spaces;” says Richard Hassell; one of the two co-founders of the Singapore-based architecture practice; WOHA.With these developments located at highly accessible public transport nodes; it can also support a more car-lite future where more people use active mobility options or public transport. “When you have certain amenities within close proximity that you can reach quickly by foot there is really no need to use the car at all;” says Thomas. 08ABOVEA COMMUNAL SPACE AT SKYVILLE @ DAWSON.PHOTO CREDIT:PATRICK BINGHAM-HALL0910Living in a gardenWOHA incorporated 1.5 hectares of lush public gardens into the Housing Development Board’s SkyVille @ Dawson; a new generation of public housing in Queenstown that is raising the bar with its clever design features; emphasising greenery; flexibility and good living. Residents get to enjoy mature rain trees and natural breeze in the common walkways and lift lobbies. Beyond this; “it is also about the public spaces within buildings and social spaces where; instead of always feeling restricted in vertical spaces; you create horizontal movements;” says Wong Mun Summ; WOHA’s other co-founder. These provide plenty of opportunities for residents to meet up. “Social encounters come when you walk horizontally;” he adds. WOHA is now exploring urban eco-systems – interconnected; citywide green spaces that are designed to support nature. These act as wildlife refuges in the heart of the city. Environmentally; both aesthetic and biologically functional properties can improve liveability. Aquatic plants can absorb and sequester away pollutants; attract desirable biodiversity and lower the ambient air temperature; damselflies and dragonflies eliminate mosquitoes; and plants with dust-removal and sound-reduction properties can complement more traditional engineering solutions.“Being close to nature can result in improved physical and mental health and mitigate some of the effects associated with high-density urban environments;” says Thomas. “You only have to see how Singaporeans respond to the otters in Marina Bay and Bishan Park;” adds Richard. “People’s spirits rise when they see wild animals.”Adaptable spacesAnother area that WOHA paid close attention to for SkyVille @ Dawson is the adaptability of its living spaces to changing needs. “It would be nice to be able to live [at SkyVille @ Dawson] for your entire life;” says Mun Summ. “But then we have to think about getting married; having the first child; the second child; having a home office; working from home; having to move out because you’re going to have three or four kids; and then you get old; and the grandparents want to move in. We thought through all this; and what’s really important is to allow the apartment to be flexible; to actually change the configuration inside;” he adds. WOHA designed the units so that they had a basic rectangular structure that enables residents to easily alter the interior as their lifestyles and needs change.OPPOSITE AND ABOVESKYVILLE @ DAWSON INTEGRATES LUSHLY LANDSCAPED PUBLIC SPACES.PHOTO CREDIT:PATRICK BINGHAM-HALL11Going 3D With our living challenges becoming more complex; perhaps there needs to be new paradigm shifts as well. “The segregation of uses has served its purpose; but as our lives get more complicated – particularly in Singapore; where we’re trying to do more and more with the same amount of land – it makes sense to plan more three-dimensionally;” says Richard.The co-founders of WOHA suggest that as cities try to do more and more with finite resources; they must consider how to optimise what they have. Richard says that urban planners and designers have to start thinking: “How best to make use of the roof? The upper level? The ground level?” He says that WOHA believes future urban designs will be designed in a three-dimensional way; for instance; utilising roof space to cultivate solar energy in an energy-short world. “Every building has to serve a national purpose;” says Mun Summ. An interconnected three-dimensional approach to urban development is difficult as it requires a great amount of cooperation and high-level collaboration; but WOHA believes this is critical for the future of city planning; urban and architectural design.

Tomorrow’s workers want to feel like their work has meaning; says Veerappan Swaminathan; director of OneMaker Group; a pioneer of the Maker Movement in Singapore. The Maker Movement has been gaining traction in urban centres around the world; including Singapore; as do-it-yourself enthusiasts like Veerappan establish Makerspaces. These are bustling workshops where people congregate to share skills and knowledge as tinkerers; students; hobbyists; designers; engineers; entrepreneurs; innovators and inventors. In these spaces; makers can fabricate anything imaginable. Whether it’s a customised widget that solves a very specific problem or an artisanal object crafted with finesse; the things they make share one critical similarity – they are highly customised and localised products. Daring to disruptAs discerning consumers become increasingly dissatisfied with mass-market goods; they’re demanding niche products to suit very specific preferences and needs. Traditional modes of production are well-equipped to churn out thousands of identical items. But they will not fulfill requests for highly specialised one-off items or small lots. Hence why consumers are either making things themselves; or joining the new wave of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro enterprises that have begun to satisfy this area of demand by leveraging new “disruptive” technologies.The accessibility and affordability of new technologies in additive manufacturing (or more commonly known as 3D printing); advanced robotics and automation have lowered the barriers to entry in manufacturing; creating opportunities for smaller players to get in the game; being nimble enough to respond quickly to changing market needs with experimentation and prototyping. As a production base for high-tech products; Singapore stands to benefit from increased trade in high-tech and high-value goods and services. Within this new frontier; makerspace operators like OneMaker Group and high-tech manufacturers such as homegrown HOPE Technik are leading a change in not just the way we work but how our workspaces look like as well – these and other emerging trends affecting the future of work and the economy will shape the way planners consider land uses; spaces and infrastructure needs for the future.Makerspaces as garages Inside an industrial space in Tai Seng; a group of young men and women gathers around an instructor who demonstrates how to use a jigsaw to cut a wooden plank. In another room; a pair of inventors hold up an arm cast made using a 3D printer that they designed and built themselves. This is XPC; a Makerspace operated by OneMaker Group and occupying about 20;000 square feet of space in the headquarters of hardware retailer Home-Fix D.I.Y. Home-Fix is one of six companies that collaborated to establish OneMaker Group (OMG); the others are the Sustainable Living Lab (SL2); Simplifi3D; Eian Williams Consulting; Focustech Ventures and SmartSpace. Together they operate four Makerspaces in Singapore – the Prototyping Lab @ National Design Centre; Community Lab @ United World College of South East Asia and 20 Peck Seah Street – each catering to different audiences and interests. Within these spaces; OMG provides affordable access to specialised equipment such as 3D printers; hand tools; power tools and even electronics for anyone who wishes to “make”; either for the satisfaction of creative self-expression or the purpose of pursuing a marketable idea. The group also helps inventors develop prototypes and promote them; and budding entrepreneurs 14OPPOSITE AND ABOVEMAKERSPACES SET UP BY THE ONEMAKER GROUP AND HOPE TECHNIK ALLOW THEIR USERS TO CRAFT; INVENT AND CREATE.15These and other emerging trends affecting the future of work and the economy will shape the way planners consider land uses; spaces and infrastructure needs for the future.access business support services; hot desks and start-up capital.Veerappan says the Makerspaces accommodate people with varied levels of expertise; from young kids who want to motorise their skateboards; to artists involved in interactive installations. “We have several companies working on hardware products trying to tackle problems and bring them to production;” he says. “So some are doing it as a hobby; some are doing it as a job or career and some want to make the next big thing.” “In Singapore; nobody has a garage;” says Low Cheong Kee; founder of Home-Fix; who would like to see more makerspaces co-located in primary and secondary schools; particularly if they’re open to the community; as well as institutes of higher learning. OMG has also considered the possibility of co-locating makerspaces in hospitals; which are a hotbed of innovation; and technology companies; which can use makerspaces as a productive way for staff to interact and benefit from “cross-pollination” of ideas.makerspaces as the maker movement looks set to be an important driving force for change. When asked about their “ideal” spaces; Veerappan says that the “intent” and growing communities come first and the conventional planning model that is resource-driven may not work. “Things are changing very fast;” says Cheong Kee. “Certain rules and regulations (on land uses) may need to be reviewed further to allow for greater flexibility.”For these reasons; the group wants to grow the HOPE for the futureOn the other side of town in Penjuru Close Industrial Estate; HOPE Technik is also reimagining the future of work and workspaces. The engineering firm has a staff strength of almost 100 divided into six different business units; each handling unique areas of high-performance technology. It’s a sci-fi-esque plethora including unmanned systems; industrial robotics; special vehicle operations; composite carbon fibre manufacturing; low-volume manufacturing and special projects that range from sea all the way to space; from a laproscopic 16“Physical space-wise we have a very brutal open In the company’s lobby; a polished steel slide that prototype for keyhole surgery to a 19-tonne combat aircraft model used for training.curves down from the main office on the second floor tells visitors that this is no ordinary space.

The radio plays Led Zeppelin as team members wander in and out of the huge pantry. Meeting rooms are available for quiet time; and people can sleep in hammocks or sleeping bags in “crash areas”; a small detail that’s a big plus for people who have dedicated sleepless nights to their projects.Happy hour is taken very seriously at HOPE; where after hours everyone mingles and shares ideas; problems and solutions. “It’s all about communication;” says Peter; “to get everyone together.” It’s also about commitment; though; as HOPE Technik is a rarity in today’s labour market – an employer who promises a career and not just a contract.Workspace is always an issue for HOPE; with limitations affecting work flow; co-sharing and warehousing and supply processes. “We’re estimated to grow out of this space in two years;” explains Peter; who adds that the company trajectory is to double the business year-on-year.Peter hopes to build a new facility that maximises height; the first four floors of which would be accessed by ramps for heavy vehicles so the company can do away with the capacity limitations of cargo lifts. The higher floors will continue with greenery and light in more traditional spaces with smart features to reduce operational costs. And with a wink to the company’s brand; the building’s overall shape will be a giant H. Above all; however; it’s the height that matters. “We understand the DNA of the country;” says Peter. “Space is not what we have a lot of; it’s very costly and manufacturing is difficult because we are one of the most expensive cities in the world.” Despite all that; the future of work looks bright; thanks to an army of innovative; dedicated makers.It’s not just work environments that are changing Campus towns – universities are also re-looking at how their campuses can be designed to nurture students for the future. The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)’s new campus is one such example. Integrated with future creative cluster industries in the new Punggol downtown district as part of the larger creative and learning corridor under the Master Plan 2014; the live-work-play-learn environment is envisioned to offer a new kind of ecosystem that enables academics; students and workers to benefit from a cross-sharing of resources; spaces and ideas.Surrounding the campus is the Punggol downtown. Residents are welcome to use SIT’s facilities including classrooms; workshops and a multi-purpose hall. SIT also plans to offer open lectures with visiting professors and invite SMEs in private enterprises to share their challenges for students to use as learning projects.The new campus offers a rare opportunity for a university to design the ideal learning centre of the future. “We need to look into the crystal ball and ask ourselves what learning is going to look like in 2030;”says SIT president Professor Tan Thiam Soon. “A simple example is; ‘What will a library look like in 2030 if every piece of information that you might need is in the cloud?’ A library can be a place where students gather to collaborate; but does that space then need to be a library?” “That is just one of many questions;” says Thiam Soon. “What will learning look like in 2030? Can we build a campus that not only meets our needs in 2020; but can withstand the changes that will come in 2030?” “So there is a lot of rethinking about space; connectivity; physical; virtual and how they can come together; even questioning the role of a university. If a student can learn certain things online; then what is the role of a university? If a student comes to a university; what activities can they engage in that they can’t on their own? We are currently in the midst of this debate;” he says.In asking questions about space usage and design; they are asking fundamental questions about the very nature of a university education. “A student doesn’t really need a university to pick up dots of knowledge; he can always Google;” Thiam Soon smiles. “What a university needs to teach is how to connect the dots and how to make sense of them and apply them. That will affect the way you design your classroom; your learning spaces and the way you make sure it’s fit for purpose.” Amid the discussion is a perennial topic for Singapore; and Asia as well – land scarcity.megacity where land constraint is real?” asks Thiam Soon. “A university in Singapore will never be like Cambridge or Yale. We don’t have the luxury; and yet you want it to be a warm learning space. How do you create that within 12 or 15 storeys?” Amid continuing questions; people like Thiam Soon are exploring innovative answers. What will learning look like in 2030? Whatever the outcome; one can be sure it will look exciting. “How do you build a university campus in a For more information about the OneMaker Group and their activities; go to youtube.com/URASingapore for a video interview with the team.

Could this be applied to Singapore? Writer Serene TngBehind Ibasho café is a group of energetic community elders who not just serve you tea; they run a farmer’s market; a noodle shop and have organised over 300 events; bringing together 11;000 visitors and residents in two years. The café was founded on the premise that everyone wants to be useful to others regardless of age; social status; physical or cognitive capabilities. According to its founder; Dr Emi Kiyota; a quote she found in an elementary school in Bhutan sums up its essence: “the time to be happy is now; the place to be happy is here; and the way to be happy is to make others  happy”. The café was started in 2011 as a response to the desire to rebuild communities after the Great East Japan Earthquake destroyed major parts of Ofunato; a city in the Iwate prefecture in Japan. It was the elders living in the area who wanted to do something meaningful in giving back to their community. The Ibasho Sozo Project; a non-profit group was formed and within two years; the community elders successfully led and ran an informal gathering space; overseeing all aspects of its operations from planning to finance. Since the café was completed in June 2013; all generations have connected to the space; with children coming to read books in the library; older people teaching the young and younger people helping elders navigate technology and more. Emi shares with Skyline how cities can build communities that integrate and value its elders.Why start the cafe?More than one in 10 people are over 60 years old today. By 2050; one in five people will be over 60 and 80 percent of these will be living in developing countries. With the simultaneous rise in the number of elderly and in climate-related natural disasters; societies worldwide are facing two critical challenges – caring for an unprecedented number of elderly in our society and reducing their vulnerability from disasters. Our common perception of ageing is that the elderly are generally a vulnerable group. There is a sense of social isolation; of irrelevance; a loss of dignity and respect. This perception is not sustainable financially. If we continue to marginalise older people and treat them solely as a vulnerable group to be cared for; the demographics alone will 18OPPOSITE AND ABOVE (TOP)ELDERS AT THE IBASHO CAFÉ TRANSFER THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND KEEP LOCAL TRADITIONS ALIVE THROUGH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VEGETABLE FARMING; TEACHING TOY MAKING AND RUNNING A NOODLE SHOP.ABOVE (BOTTOM) A JAPANESE ELDER VISITS THE IBASHO FARM IN ORMOC; PHILIPPINES TO HELP IMPROVE IT.PHOTO CREDIT:YASUHIRO TANAKA 19bankrupt economies around the world. The Ibasho concept offers an innovative low-cost option in response to this ageing challenge. It recognises the value and resources that elders can bring being part of the solution; not only to ease economic pressures but to also live their lives with dignity and purpose. It also builds up the community’s resilience and its ability to withstand shocks such as disasters and ageing by creating a strong informal support system where the elders become the catalyst to strengthen bonds among community members of all ages.What is the value of multi-generational interactions?As part of my graduate research; I chose to live with elders in long term care facilities to understand their needs. I noticed that while the staff did their best to provide the residents with a safe place to live; the elders still experienced feelings of loneliness; boredom; helplessness and desperation. No one really plans to or wants to live in a long term care facility. This brings up difficult questions – would I be comfortable with having my loved one in this situation when the time comes? Would I be able to face these living conditions myself? Unfortunately; ageing is not an option. It is a natural part of our lives that nobody can avoid. So; what can we do to improve people’s lives in their later years? It’s not about ensuring that we have luxury or beautiful buildings. These will not make people happy. The elders living in grass huts in Africa with children at their feet are often happier than those living in assisted homes with a chandelier over their heads.In creating a non-institutional environment filled with multi-generational interactions; the elders are not treated as people who need to be cared for but have opportunity to contribute to their community as valuable resources. There is much discussion about recognising the value of the elderly and the benefits of multi-generational interactions; however; its implementation is still a challenge. Ibasho demonstrates a practical option that is elders led; low-cost; with the potential to strengthen the social ties of people of all ages. What does it take to make it work?We need to firstly see the elderly as part of the solution; empowering them to be able to lead and run programmes effectively; while providing them with the support they need to develop those skills; especially in the early stages of development and operation. It is important to define the role of the experts to serve as facilitators for the elders to create their own place and programme; enabling them to become fully integrated as active participants and leaders. Involving the younger generation in the development and operational processes is also important in making it attractive for them to want to be part of the community.The physical environment plays a part as well in fostering a sense of place and ownership. Walkability is crucial given the limited mobility amongst the elderly community. There should be easy and inexpensive access to the place. To ensure the success and long term viability of such a project; the community must find ways to involve the local government without compromising its community led approach. Part of the process is also about changing the mindsets about ageing even amongst the elderly and encouraging a strong support system.What surprises you about the perceptions of the elderly at the start? Ageism is deeply rooted in our society including amongst the elders themselves. Society perceives ageing as a negative thing and expects elders to be people who need to be looked after by the government. There is a sense of dependency among elderly for the government to provide all the necessary services. They are conditioned to think and behave in certain ways; suffering from a lack of self-worth. When forming the non-profit group to run the Ibasho cafe; a 67 year-old man commented to me: “Aren’t we too old to start an organisation?” What can we learn from this? During the development phase of the project; it dawned on me that there are not many opportunities for the elderly to contribute their skills back to society. But actually every one of us has something to offer and share; whether young or old. The elders running a self-sustainable operation in the café within the Ibasho principle framework have exceeded our expectations. The elderly have a lot to offer and bring to the table. They have a wide network from their professions and through the 20young people they have mentored; including a deep connection with the local community. They bring valuable experience and skills; having gone through a lot of hardships in their lives. An elderly woman’s comment to me sums up the sentiments of the elders who participated in the project: “I am so glad that I am involved in the Ibasho project because I don’t have to feel helpless anymore.”What are your future plans for the Ibasho cafe?We have so far started the Ibasho café in two locations; the first one in a disaster area in Japan and the second one in Ormoc; Leyte; Philippines; an area affected by Typhoon Haiyan. I hope to be able to replicate our approach globally. Our goal is to create a global support network amongst the elders who are involved in the Ibasho project. In this network; we can facilitate peer-to-peer exchange programmes to learn from and help each other. We would also like to develop training programmes for the elderly to take on leadership roles to set up the Ibasho project within communities in their countries. We are currently in discussion with local municipalities in Japan; public housing operators in the United States; and a local community in Nepal to develop the Ibasho café as a community driven initiative to enable local elders to age in community. We would also like to explore setting up Ibasho café-type social spaces in Singapore. The peer-to-peer exchange programmes can have a significant impact particularly on those who are able to share and impart knowledge from their experience of running the cafe. An elder from the Ibasho café who was involved in helping to set up the Ibasho café in the Philippines shared: “I’ve always thought that helping people in other countries is beyond us. But I realise that we don’t have to be part of the United Nations or international organisations to make a difference. Any one of us can be useful and be of help. We have received so much help from others in rebuilding our communities that now is our turn to do something for the people in the Philippines. There is a lot I want to do with them and to learn from them. I hope we can help each other for a long time.” What can planners and designers learn from this; in addressing the issue of ageing in cities?Creating spaces and places for people to gather in an informal setting is important in building up resilient communities and providing the elderly with a sense of purpose. From the project; we found that Ibasho users had more friends; a higher sense of self-efficacy and belonging to their community. We need to find ways to continuously bring the younger and older generations together; fostering a culture where they can learn from one other. We need to start breaking down age-segregated places; for example childcare centres or the libraries. We need to ensure that such spaces and communities are all inclusive; to include and link up to people who are dissimilar or from other communities. The quality of our physical environments does matter although the environment alone by itself does not address all of the ageing challenge. But the environment itself does have a strong impact on how we view and behave in relating to each other. Many of the ageing related service buildings tend to have a certain institutional look and feel that may signal that the environment is more for the elderly. In designing spaces where the elderly will gather; we need to be mindful to design spaces that break down the barriers; to make the environment as attractive; comfortable and safe as possible. It is also important to empower and include the elders throughout the design; construction and programme development and operation to strengthen a sense of ownership of the place. Because the elders at the Ibasho café were so deeply involved in the design and process; they were so proud to bring their friends and families around. Community-driven projects like the Ibasho café cannot solve all the issues related to global ageing or the vulnerability of elders during and after natural disasters. But such projects give the elderly power and self-determination; showing that they have much to give and can foster greater engagement amongst all members of the community. By creating a place where elders can help their neighbours; the Ibasho café has made the community stronger and more integrated. The Ibasho approach offers a long-term sustainable model of incorporating elders more fully into their communities that can enrich their lives. It presents a nuanced way to build up more resilient communities.More information on the Ibasho café can be found on www.ibasho.org.Dr Emi Kiyota is an environmental gerontologist and organisational culture change expert.

Writer Daniel SeifertPhotographer Wilson PangAs the clocks chime 6pm in the small Spanish town of Sabadelle; a strange sight wanders across the public square: a bald man in a tuxedo. He’s clutching a cello. He begins to play quietly. Seconds later he’s joined by another cello; then an oboe and five violins. Within a few minutes there’s a full orchestra (complete with a choir) belting out Beethoven’s Ode to Joy. This flash mob attracted nearly 64.5 million views on Youtube since 2012. It’s a testimony to what you can do with a plain old patch of public space; a handful of instruments and some 230-year-old public domain music. This flash mob phenomenon is just one facet demonstrating how cities around the world are waking up to public spaces; and asking what it can do to add some playground fun and sparkle to the neighbourhood. So how is Singapore playing its part?Space possibilitiesTo find out; we check in with one of the driving forces behind PubliCity; a URA initiative started in 2013 to celebrate spaces through design and community engagement. It’s a ten-year project; says Marcia Morley; URA’s executive architect and one of the first phases is simple. “It’s actually about realising the potential of a lot of existing public spaces.” Singapore; she marvels; boasts an amazing amount of public spaces; much more than people would think. Her voice echoes slightly; as we’re sitting in just one such example: the pop-up park in the URA Centre. What was formerly an empty space has been dolled up with inviting seats and grass mats. Who would have thought?People think that they cannot use space or cannot do things in a space in a certain way;” says Marcia. “So the first part is about demonstrating possibilities. We’re activating spaces ourselves with pop up programmes; like this pop up park at URA. So it’s us jumping into the deep end taking on the responsibility of providing platforms to activate “We’ve got a perception issue at the moment. public space; but always trying to get someone from the community to actually take the role of managing the space while we’re activating it.” Ownership; she says; should always rest with the public as well; so they feel part of the process.But perhaps there’s a question that should be answered first: why bother with public spaces at all? How do they affect a city? For one thing; they give us a reason to go outside. That’s important; now that we spend the majority of our time sitting at work; slumped in cars and lounging at home. There’s a pressing need to get people outdoors; moving; interacting and socialising. Public spaces can do that; says Amanda Burden. She ought to know – she was the chief city planner for New York City under Mayor Bloomberg. “If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner;” she said in a stellar TED talk; “it is that public spaces have power.”And; as she adds; “It’s not just the number of people using them; it’s the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city; [and] how you feel about a city.”Honk if you love aromatherapy!Enter PARK(ing) Day; which aims to change how we feel about the unofficial mascot of cities everywhere: parking lots. A global annual event; the URA and Housing Development Board supported this from 2014; seeing the opportunity to get people to re-look at public spaces and the potential of them; starting with the ordinary car park lot. For a day; people get to ‘own’ a lot and can do anything they want with it. People came out in full force on 18 September 2015 for PARK(ing) Day in spite of the haze; turning 140 car park lots into fun and interesting public spaces. One of them is Lorenzo Petrillo; an Italian designer based in Singapore. His goal? To transform nearly the entire stretch of Keong Saik Road’s parking spaces into an amusement park. Goodbye cars; hello comfy seats (surrounded by fresh herbs 22ABOVE NEIGHBOURS INTERACT AND PLAY IN A BACK ALLEY DURING DOOR TO DOOR; A STREET FESTIVAL HELD AT EVERTON PARK IN 2015 THAT GOT RESIDENTS RETHINKING THEIR PUBLIC SPACES.23to Door mini-lending library. “It’s an oh; I didn’t know you could do that kind of thing. Just getting people to think like this is a huge success; to get them to rethink their spaces.” Sean’s mom certainly is. As he speaks; his mother whoops as she scores a strike on a small free-for-all grass bowling strip.Much like Mrs Gwee’s bowling ball; Door to Door has been a smashing success. After two incarnations of the event; the local community took up the baton; and sought permission to paint the wall in an even bigger scale as a community art project. Much like the movie Pay It Forward; it seems that one person with a generous idea can spread it to others. Before you know it; a good deed has gone viral. That’s a philosophy Social Creatives completely understands. The local non-profit art group champions the power of artwork to rewire our brains and hearts; all while beautifying our surroundings. It’s much more than just painting on walls; says Siti Hawa Ahmad Yussof; a member of Social Creatives. “The back story of it is to actually connect people and to give them ownership of their surroundings.” Take a physical step to beautify your neighbourhood; and something amazing happens. “What I loved most when working with Social Creatives was the sense of camaraderie we mutually feel with each other; almost like another family away from family.”Story of five birdsMore than that; Social Creatives’ work can bridge social gaps in society; connecting the affluent with those who need help; says Siti. “We’ve done several projects in one-room flats; and these always bring back interesting stories.” In one flat; the company’s artistic manager met a young child wearing a school uniform; despite it being a weekend. Curious; he asked why. The child replied that there was nothing else to wear.“Another story is of a resident requesting for fivebirds to be painted onto the wall. When asked why; he said it was to signify his children; who had already left the nest and disowned him;” Siti says quietly. ”It’s stories like these that tug at the heartstrings and force us to reflect; to be grateful for our blessings; to be more appreciative of the people in our lives.”Scratch the surface and you find an army of Singaporeans who say that transforming society can start in a public space. Koh Hui Ling; associate director of Drama Box; is one of them. One of this group’s most innovative projects is GoLi – The Moving Theatre; a giant inflatable venue that can be for a quick whiff of aromatherapy); artworks; and even a small dipping pool. It’s a lofty project; but Keong Saik is in safe hands. This ain’t Lorenzo’s first rodeo: he designed similar amusements for public spaces in Milan; including screenings; pop-up bars; and foosball tables on wheels. As Lorenzo sums up that particular Italian extravaganza; “Our instructions were: give back piazzas to the people.”What’s more; he’s passionate about human-centred design; and feels cities need it more than ever. “My big frustration is that cities are developing around cars;” he sighs. And yes; he admits; it’s difficult to shift our dependence on autos down a gear; but “as a designer I can tell you there’s always a solution. If we develop and improve public transport; or work on car sharing; this city can be even more beautiful.” spaces can be the sweet antidote to a global problem. “A common issue around the world is that people are becoming selfish; protecting their own property and space.” The government here; he says with praise; has wisely invested in creating racial and national harmony. Now it’s time to zoom in and push a sense of community. “In my experience what public events do is not only transform a public space and show how to enjoy it in a different way; but also get people to socialise.”the businesses of Keong Saik together. “I’m excited because some of the other stakeholders want to do stuff too; asking can I do a bakery class? Another lady wants to do a workshop on cutting clothes. An Indian restaurant will bring Bollywood dancers. So you see how all these cultures come together.”Listening to him; you get the sense that public In fact; Lorenzo’s efforts have already brought Knock knock; it’s artHappily; initiatives like this are popping up everywhere thanks to people like Lorenzo and Sean Gwee; the mind behind Door to Door. Because of Sean and his team; Everton Park’s back alleys were transformed with their own amusement park flair. A band of doodlers – named; coincidentally; Band of Doodlers – pimped out a blank wall with funky artwork. Henna artists turned passerby arms into living sketchbooks. Homemade kampong games were being played by giggling kids. Jugglers made clubs and hoops dance acrobatically in the air. All this; says Sean; was set up for under $100. “What we really like about these street festivals is people aren’t used to these events happening in their alleys;” Sean smiles as he sits next to the Door 24ABOVE IN 2015; POP-UP PARKS TOOK OVER THE ROADS ON PARK(ING) DAY; A GLOBAL MOVEMENT THAT RECLAIMS PARKING LOTS FOR PEDESTRIANS.2526ABOVE (TOP)RESIDENTS PARTICIPATE IN STREET ART AT THE FIRST STREETS FOR PEOPLE CAR-FREE ZONE AT MAJU AVENUE IN 2015.

So I guess it is important for us to continue thinking about how to use our space creatively and critically; beyond economic needs but helping the basic needs of human beings – the need to belong; socialise and bond.”Less kiasu; more coolnessThe campaign to storm public spaces with positivity is going strong; it seems. What needs to be done to keep up the momentum? “A big hurdle is just overcoming the idea that you can actually take a chance;” Marcia shares. “Because Singapore has grown so quickly and been so successful; the current mindset is you have to be super kiasu and make sure everything will succeed completely.” Hopefully; says Marcia; this mindset can be shifted to something that breeds more proactive; fearless projects; where “if you fail it’s okay; you’ve given it a go.”For Lorenzo; one hurdle to overcome is more Luckily he has some daydreams for cool projects.practical: the weather. “At first I thought one problem is the heat and rain. But then you look at photos of people 50 years ago; and everything happened outdoors. So I’ve started believing that this feeling can come back. People have been spoiled by aircon a bit.” “I have one idea; a massive waterslide a couple hundred metres long. It would be fun; fresh; easy.” Another brainwave? A bench that doubles as a social-hub-meets-disco. “I also designed a rocking chair for six people. One of my dreams is to have 50 of these on the east coast. And to rock; the people have to interact with each other to swing back and forth. You could have solar panels on top; install wi-fi points; it could give local information; play music; have a map.”Seats that literally rock? It’s probably people like Lorenzo that city planner Amanda Burden had in mind when she said; “I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time.”For more information on PubliCity; go to ura.sg/publicitysg.

Writer Jen EvelandUrban mobility is one of the most difficult challenges facing city leaders today because transportation affects economies; communities and the environment in equal measure. For Singapore; where 710 square kilometers accommodates over five million people; the mobility challenge becomes even more critical. 12 percent of the island’s total land area is lost to roads – close to the 14 percent occupied by housing. Rapid urbanisation; rising carbon dioxide levels and resource scarcity will place even more demands on the transportation system. The writing is on the wall for the personal automobile as climate change moves to the forefront of our individual and collective awareness. In short: a transportation system built around cars is simply unsustainable. Instead; Singapore has begun to push for a greater use of public transport and to develop disruptive technologies to offer new transport options that will use space more efficiently; such as self-driving vehicles (SDVs) which can be used for shared purposes. The city is also laying the foundation for an environment that is conducive for active mobility such as walking and cycling.Making strides for active mobilityThe focus on walking and cycling is in fact an integral part of the Master Plan of 2014; which also incorporates a National Cycling Plan. The Land Transport Master Plan 2013; by the Land Transport Authority (LTA); has called for proposals for a public bike-sharing system; with plans to pilot them by the end of 2015.Similar efforts will soon be seen in Ang Mo Kio; where new measures will establish walking and cycling paths; pedestrian priority zones at bus stops; traffic calming measures; bike crossings and parking facilities and a corridor connecting the Yio Chu Kang MRT station to Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park; all by 2018. Plans are also underway for a code of conduct to promote safety and mutual consideration between all road and pavement users.“The desired end state is one where we have asafe on and off-road environment and where there is mutual respect among pedestrians; motorists and cyclists;” says Jeffery Goh; president of the Singapore Cycling Federation. “There is no better time than the present;” says Jeffery; “to introduce a purposeful and deliberate programme to educate and bring greater awareness on safe cycling etiquette and skills. More so now; as there is a significant growth in the number of recreational and serious cyclists as well as those who use bicycles for commuting purposes.”Tropical cities like Singapore also have special considerations when it comes to the comfort of pedestrians and cyclists amid the heat and heavy rains. As such there is a greater need for facilities like shade; shelter and end-of-trip amenities. Commuters who walk or cycle can be helped by infrastructure that allows seamless connectivity and integrates transit nodes for the first and last miles of their journeys. Sharing space with graceA new set of pavement users is jockeying for position among pedestrians and cyclists – scooters. Use of small electric motorised vehicles; called e-scooters; is becoming popular. Not surprising; as these vehicles can travel up to 60 kilometres with an added battery pack on a single charge; and fold within seconds for carrying on buses and trains.The Big Wheel Scooters Singapore (BWSS); an online community for e-scooter users; has grown to 7;200 members in just two years since its founding in 2013; and BWSS chairman Denis Koh believes there are many more scooter riders who have yet to join. Denis says that ideally e-scooters can supplement the first and last miles of a commute; with riders scooting to the nearest Mass Rapid Transit station; folding the scooter to enter the train; and then scooting from the station to their workplace. “This way of commuting is clean; it’s green; it’s viable and sustainable;” says Denis. However; he believes that Singapore needs to develop rules and norms for usage.or cannot be done;” says Denis. “We can then promote the safe and harmonious use of shared spaces. The authorities have placed extensive capital expenditure on infrastructure creating wider footpaths and cycling lanes. An Active Mobility Unit has also been set up;” he says; of the recent initiative by the LTA to coordinate routes within the city and “We need some form of control and what can 28PHOTO CREDIT (CLOCKWISE FROM TOP RIGHT):KRISTIAN ERIC MAGLALANG; CHAN WAI MENG; GINA NG ZHI TING29education initiatives among all users; including pedestrians; cyclers and scooters.Denis says that BWSS will continue to engage the community; educate and perhaps provide safety training for scooters. In fact; they have already produced a safety video. He has also been working on an insurance scheme for personal mobility device users. In the area of data analytics; the LTA’s Planet The role of technologyThree areas of technology and innovation have been identified that will propel Singapore’s public transportation system into the future: data analytics; the interface between commuters and transport service providers and SDVs. project; a joint project with business and technical partners; is already pooling data at a central depository and providing new ways to analyse this information to observe areas of congestion. The URA and LTA are also teaming up with the Future Cities Laboratory; a research partnership between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and Singapore’s National Research Foundation at the Singapore-ETH Centre for Global Environmental Sustainability. The MATSim Singapore project is a multi-agent simulation model that will simulate commuters’ travel patterns and behaviours.Effective tools for commuters provide a level of convenience that can steer them towards mass transit choices; such as the LTA’s MyTransport.SG portal; which provides links to land transport-related apps; interactive maps and the latest government campaigns and initiatives. Mobile apps like Beeline; developed by the Infocomm Development Authority and LTA; uses data analytics to provide Singapore’s first crowdsourced bus service platform; cleverly adapting service to demand. Third-party taxi booking apps like Grab Taxi and ridesharing apps like Uber are also gaining popularity.Other innovations involve seamless payment systems; such as Be-In-Be-Out; a hands-free technology which can detect commuters without their having to tap a card or their phones. Singapore-based DP Architects has also proposed smart bus stops that incorporate wi-fi; phone charging and way-finding.Driverless carsDespite a comprehensive active mobility plan and extensive network of trains and buses; there will still be demand for personal transportation; but it must take a different approach to the glut of fossil fuel-burning automobiles in use today. Tomorrow’s personal transportation will most likely take the form of pods that will cover the transportation needs of individuals for short hops and for the first and last mile part of their long journeys; according to Professor Daniela Rus; Autonomous Vehicle principal investigator at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology and director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Mobility on demand will see a transportation network connected to an information technology infrastructure and also to people; allowing the system to adapt to people’s needs using real-time and historical transportation data to determine routes and locations of stops. This mobility on demand will be facilitated by state-of-the-art technologies for self-driving vehicles; says Daniela.Trials are already underway here. The Committee on Autonomous Road Transport for Singapore is exploring the future of SDVs in Singapore; and to support its efforts the LTA has formed a partnership with A*STAR; Singapore’s leading research and development agency; to create the Singapore Autonomous Vehicle Initiative (SAVI). SAVI trials under the SMART MIT-NUS alliance have taken place at Jurong Lake District and the National University of Singapore campus; with trials also ongoing at one-north connecting Biopolis; Fusionopolis and Mediapolis over public road networks. The Ministry of Transport estimates that in 10 or 15 years; the number of passenger vehicles in Singapore will be reduced by a third thanks to SDVs. “Taking a driverless car will be as easy as using a smartphone;” says Daniela; “and the commute will let you return calls and catch up on your favorite podcasts. After driving people to their destination; the robot pods will drive themselves to the next customer; using demand-matching and coordination algorithms to optimise the operations of the fleet and minimise people’s waiting time.”But she says there are many technological and policy challenges before SDVs are broadly deployed.driving vehicles at low speeds in low complexity environments;” says Daniela. “We need to develop algorithms and systems for safe self-driving at high speeds in complex environments and inclement weather. Policy makers need to consider the access; liability; safety; and security issues around self-driving cars.”“Our work at SMART demonstrated self-“I look forward to a zero-barrier environment Accessibility for everyoneWhether for recreation or commute; the key to successful urban mobility will be an inclusive and sharing mentality among every path; rail and road user. That’s a broad spectrum; one that covers pedestrians; cyclers; scooters; mass transit riders; personal transport users and even travelers with special needs. where people can choose to wheelchair; walk; cycle on walkways around the entire island of Singapore;” says Dr William Tan; a paralympic athlete and ultra-marathoner. “It is so heartwarming that; enabled by the provision of accessible facilities; many with challenges in mobility are participating and integrating with mainstream communities;” he adds.Denis also embraces this spirit of inclusivity when he says: “There is no one solution to handle active mobility in the city state. It would be an ongoing process to ensure harmony amongst all stakeholders.”30A look at self-driving vehiclesPang Kin Keong; Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) is leading the Committee on Autonomous Road Transport for Singapore. He believes self-driving vehicles have the revolutionary potential to shape Singapore’s transport system and shares his vision and excitement on getting self-driving vehicles (SDVs) on the road.How close are we to putting SDVs on the road?I think the world is about 10 to 15 years away from public use and deployment. Looking at the pace of development and amount of research globally; I would venture that it’ll be sooner rather than later. How are we gearing ourselves to tap on the technology? We’ve kicked off several trials; not just to test the technology; but more interestingly; transportation and mobility concepts based on the technology. Concurrently; LTA is working on a regulatory and liability framework that will enable public use of self-driving vehicles. The trials will allow us to gain important insights into the regulatory and infrastructural requirements that we will eventually need to put in place; as well as commuter behaviour and mindsets when using and interacting with such vehicles. Our ultimate vision is to deploy self-driving vehicles as an integral part of our public transport network; to improve intra-town and first-last mile mobility; and to help us overcome manpower constraints as well.How will SDVs shape the future of transport in Singapore? They have revolutionary potential to shape Singapore’s transport system; not just evolutionary. Most of the buzz surrounding SDVs has been about how they will transform driving for the car owner. That day will come and we are preparing for it. However; replacing one driven car today with one driverless car tomorrow is not what the Singapore Government is most excited about. It will not reduce the number of cars on our roads; nor reduce the amount of land needed for roads and car parks. What is revolutionary is applying the technology to public and shared forms of transport; bringing new forms of mobility for the masses with the convenience and comfort of private transport. Imagine if you can call for a demand-driven; dynamically-routed; point-to-point self-driving pod through your mobile app; for your intra-town or first-last mile travel; connecting you to the MRT station or neighbourhood amenity. PHOTO CREDIT:MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT31How can they shape our lifestyles and even help businesses?The most significant limitations of our current transportation system are availability of manpower and the fact that we have limited land. The latter means that we cannot sustainably build our transportation system around private cars. And for those who take public transport; the first and last mile experience is still not great. Self-driving technology and new mobility concepts based on such technology can help us overcome these constraints.We can and should also imagine future towns to be car-lite or even car-free. We can reclaim some of the road and car park spaces and convert them into lush greenery and recreational spaces for residents.increase productivity and reduce manpower reliance. With the tight labour market in Singapore; the trucking industry faces particular hiring challenges. The autonomous truck platooning technology that MOT and Port of Singapore Authority are exploring can help the industry to do more with fewer drivers. Each driver can now command more trucks and ferry more containers during each leg of travel.We are also looking at deploying autonomous utility vehicles such as road sweepers and smaller-sized All-Terrain-Litter-Vehicles deployed for cleaning pavements. These utility vehicles can operate at night and not contribute to road traffic during the day. In freight transport; SDVs can help businesses How do you see SDVs used in towns in future?This is an area we are most excited about. We are studying how to incorporate self-driving mobility concepts into our urban plans and designs for future towns; and of course also to retrofit existing towns. We can envision a very different town of the future; with a vastly different landscape and improved living environment. A town where intra-town and first-last mile travel is largely through cycling; walking and self-driving pods; where the surface of the town is no longer dominated by roads; car parks and the noise and pollution brought about by cars; but greenery; pedestrians; cyclists and clean; quiet and safe self-driving pods. And only at the basement levels; we have roads for freight traffic; mass public transport; and cars for those who still want to own cars. If you had access to a SDV; how would you use it?I would give up my car for my daily commute to the office. I would call for a self-driving pod to pick me up from the doorstep of my house and send me to the train station. And I’d spend the commute time catching up on my reading or on sleep! (Instead of having to focus on driving and navigating and being exasperated by traffic jams and inconsiderate drivers...)The Ministry of Transport set up the Committee on Autonomous Road Transport for Singapore in August 2015 to provide strategic directions on the SDV deployment and use in Singapore. The Committee comprises experts from various fields; with 18 members from government agencies like LTA; URA and HDB and private sector organisations such as Toyota; Continental; ST Kinetics; CISCO; MIT; Singapore Technologies Kinetics and the UK Behavioural Insights Team.32ABOVESELF-DRIVING VEHICLE-ENABLED TOWN CENTRES COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO FUTURE PLANS (ARTIST’S IMPRESSION). IMAGE CREDIT:MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTAnthony Townsend on the smart cityHow “smart” our tech is depends on how we use it.Writer Cassandra YeapForecaster and urban planner Anthony Townsend has been writing; speaking and consulting on urbanisation; ubiquitous computing; technology-led innovation and economic development for many years. He talks about what it means to be a truly smart city addressing urban issues. What is a smart city? It is a collection of stakeholders in the government; industry and civic sectors who are using new digital technologies to address timeless urban problems. All cities are smart by this definition – it is impossible to do anything in a city today that doesn’t involve digital technology in at least a minor role. There are very few problems that were unsolvable without digital technology. Rather; technology can help remove barriers and constraints that were previously insurmountable using conventional ways of addressing a problem.But technology won’t work unless there are two other key ingredients – both people in government and the population need to buy into its value proposition. There must be a widespread appreciation of both the benefits and the limitations of technology.What are some pitfalls of a smart city? I think there is one pitfall from which all the others emerge; and that is a lack of foresight. Cities really need to develop a systematic process and capacity for evaluating new technology ideas and solutions rather than blindly embracing the latest; greatest thing.How are Asian cities embracing the smart city?Asian cities have done a much better job in thinking long-term about infrastructure and economic development than other parts of the world. They have demonstrated the foresight and ability to act that these kinds of initiatives require; and of course everyone recognises that Singapore is at the front of the pack. What other parts of the world; notably the United States; have done much more effectively is define a role for citizens to set the agenda and implement parts of the vision. I think part of this reflects different understandings of the role of the state in different parts of the world and countries; but it also reflects different views about where innovations come from. And for all the foresight; I worry that the Asia model may be too centrally-directed and rigid for its own good.How can Singapore leverage on technology wisely as a city-state?This is Singapore’s great advantage that no other city really has. Urban planning and national economic planning can serve the same vision. It has and will continue to be a source of advantage for smart city development. The major shortcoming I see is that it may provide too much resources! What’s driving a lot of innovation in other cities is scarcity – the need to do more with less – that is really leading to some extremely creative problem-solving and new innovation and governance models. In that sense; Singapore may have it too easy.3334How could urban planning be done differently for a smart city? This is a question that urban planners are just starting to address. Frankly; it could go either way – the tools could empower either top-down or bottom-up planning and we see evidence of both. We can learn a lot from what happened in the 1960s when computers were first widely used in urban planning by government; and the severe backlash against technocratic computer-assisted planning that occurred in many parts of the world. The difference now is that computing and data are much more widely accessible but it’s not clear if that will change the dynamic much. I suspect many conflicts in the years to come will show us the way.Much of today’s tech goes towards solving problems that modernisations of the past have created. Can we avoid creating more new problems and risks?Absolutely not. Which is why we need to get much better at assessing risks and identifying and mitigating unintended consequences. Environmental planning has shown us this is possible; although it probably means slowing down and incurring additional costs. But in the long-run it will be cheaper for society as a whole.How can the government encourage ground-up efforts for smarter cities?It needs to listen to (the public) when they say things the government doesn’t agree with or doesn’t like. It’s as simple as that – engage them.What is one area that you foresee major changes in the next five years with advancements in technology?Transportation is going to see a massive period of change that will be really gathering steam by then – Uber is just the beginning. The Internet of Things will mature; and we will start to see its great benefits and its utterly tremendous and frightening risks for privacy and cybersecurity. If all goes well; I hope; we may finally see some genuinely viable greenfield smart cities of the future.Dr Anthony Townsend is an urban planner and forecaster whose writing; public speaking; activism and consulting focus on urbanisation; ubiquitous computing; technology innovation and economic development.

URA and Esri talk about the potential of leveraging technology to really ‘walk the ground’ and the need for greater dialogue and exchange.Writer Cassandra Yeap Photographer Cheong Yue Han“Our ultimate aim is to take the technology out of planning so planners are able to concentrate on the planning aspects and not be so focused on the process of uploading; cleaning and capturing data. Technology can help them with data capture and integration with relevant systems while they walk the ground and talk to the residents in the various towns;” says Benjamin Chan; on his vision of URA’s Digital Planning Lab as its director. The Lab was set up in 2013 to exploit advanced digital planning tools and emerging technologies to transform the way planners work. Benjamin sees a possible shift in to a more data-driven focus in future. “If the digital planning tools are well designed and used; it will help us better understand the workings of the city through real-time data; enhance our ability to identify emerging concerns and trends and enable planners to better understand the impact and implications of different planning scenarios;” he adds.A new toolboxHe is already seeing shifts in the way planners work with the use of technology. Digital planning tools are helping to automate the generation of scenarios for long term concept planning for example; saving significant time and manpower resources. Technology is also enabling planners to access large volumes of data island-wide and more granular ones localised to towns and neighbourhoods to make more informed decisions. He sees this happening through the E Planner; one of the first tools that the Lab developed. It has become a significant one-stop; geospatial planning analytics multi-platform for URA planners and others from various government agencies to 36ABOVE DIGITAL PLANNING LAB DIRECTOR BENJAMIN CHAN (LEFT) AND EXECUTIVE ARCHITECT EUGENE LAU ARE TAPPING ON TECHNOLOGY FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE; RESPONSIVE URBAN PLANNING.37access and visualise over 90 data sets easily. Many different types of data and information layers can be generated at any time; from building types to demographics; opening up possible new insights for planners when considering the location of amenities; the quality of spaces and other infrastructure and development needs. It’s not just 2D layers that are being generated. Captured in 3D “We have been working with 3D modellers to produce an inventory of 3D digital models of the developments in Singapore; including street furniture and landscaping. To date; 130 square kilometers of models have been completed. To utilise these models efficiently; we have also developed a set of rules specific to URA’s planning guidelines to be used in the 3D Geographic Information System (GIS) platform (Esri City Engine) to do large scale 3D simulations; in partnership with Esri Inc;” shares Eugene Lau; URA’s executive architect who is driving many of the 3D modelling efforts. This is strengthening the way planners and architects are visualising the city when considering important view corridors to landmarks and waterfronts or determining if a building is too tall or wall-like and more.technology; planners are also prototyping 3D Leveraging on the advancements in the drone models of specific buildings; for example; on the NUS Baba House; in collaboration with local drones firm Avetics. Excited about the possibilities; Kelvin Ang; URA’s director of Conservation Management thinks 3D models can offer a new dimension and experience of conserved buildings. “Beyond serving as a digital document of our heritage for more to enjoy and appreciate; the models enable us to access rooftops and other aspects of the buildings easily and quickly; to help better plan and manage changes and restoration over time;” he says. Eugene also sees 3D digital models as a great way to share key ideas with the public. “We tapped on our collection of 3D models to produce flythroughs of Jurong Lake District and Woodlands Regional Centre to better convey our ideas during the Draft Master Plan 2013 Exhibition. We have received feedback that many found it easier to understand our plans.”Interactive Scenario-Based PlanningOn a larger scale; in order to produce the most optimal plans; planners need to take into account an increasingly diverse range of inter-dependent factors; from infrastructure facilities; to local amenities; demographics and transport networks. Platforms like the GIS-Enabled Mapping; Modelling and Analysis (GEMMA) application are allowing planners to analyse the dynamics between these 38ABOVE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS (FROM LEFT) E PLANNER AND CITYENGINE ALLOW PLANNERS TO CONSIDER MULTIPLE LAYERS OF INFORMATION AND DATA ABOUT AN AREA. DRONES HELP PLANNERS OBSERVE AND MANAGE CHANGES IN CONSERVED BUILDINGS.factors in simulations; and will enable quick assessments of alternative scenarios to lead to more robust planning.Another important tool being developed is a simulation software to guide climate-sensitive urban planning and design – the Quantitative Urban Environment Simulation Tool (QUEST). This is a collaboration with the National Environment Agency and A*STAR Institute of High Performance Computing. Supported by the Ministry of National Development and National Research Foundation*; this tool couples high-resolution atmospheric modelling with urban-scale computational fluid dynamics modelling; to generate wind; temperature and thermal comfort simulations at different planning scales. This would help planners better understand how micro-climate and thermal comfort may change with future urban development and climate change; and consider suitable interventions. The research team is currently working on a prototype tool for Jurong Lake District; with the potential to extend this to the whole island in the next phase. Dialogue and exchange of ideasUltimately; the value of planning tools and platforms is only as good as what you put into it. Beyond tapping on technology per se; there needs to be continuous dialogue and exchange. More platforms are being pursued to support this; both externally and within URA to fuel this. URA’s Urban Lab platform initiated in 2015 has been showcasing emerging technologies and cutting edge research work on urban solutions; bringing together academics; government and private sector; to further greater exchange and ideas. Some areas covered so far include exploring the use of drones for a range of uses and strategies for a more energy-secure future.Yammer; a social networking platform initiated in-house in URA in 2013 has gained traction amongst planners and architects as a key channel to share ideas; feedback on projects and inspiring developments in other cities. Some of the ideas from this platform have been implemented; like running trials to simplify signage for car park rates; creating pop-up projects to enhance public spaces and exploring the use of artificial sunlight for underground developments. This simple and easy-to-use platform has helped planners to stay curious and push boundaries in seeking out new insights for better planning outcomes.Video interviews with Benjamin Chan and Eugene Lau are available at youtube.com/URASingapore.*under L2 NIC Award No. L2NICCFP1-2013-639Smart mappingEsri is a forerunner in Geographic Information Systems technology. We catch up with Thomas Pramotedham; Esri Singapore’s chief executive officer; on the potential of smart mapping in addressing urban challenges and how citizens can be involved too. What is the potential of smart mapping? Smart mapping – delivered through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology – offers important analytical capabilities for urban planners and policy makers. The technology underpins a great number of essential services within many of the world’s most progressive cities; from improving traffic condition; optimising the delivery of health services; to policy development; providing decision makers a unique analytical vantage point to make more informed choices.engagement and education. Community sourced information can be fused with traditional land base and infrastructure information to offer more insightful views of an active city in terms of historical or real time patterns. With the visual nature and universal language of maps; policy makers can also better explain complex issues to diverse citizen groups or distil large and diverse data into visually simple layers.It can also play an important role in citizen What are the latest advancements you are most excited about? In the recent years; we’ve seen a clear shift in the level of sophistication of Esri’s 3D mapping solutions; real-time data collection; analysis tools and indoor tracking capabilities. The latest generation of smart mapping enables policy-makers; urban planners and developers to fully appreciate the cultural; economic and environmental impacts of a development by presenting options in a real-world context. In-built temporal analysis capabilities also furnish decision makers with the foresight to look beyond today to see how a proposal may impact the inhabitants of a city for generations to come. There are also exciting developments in the area of real-time big data analytics; introducing a greater level of insight for decision makers; especially in the areas of crime prevention; transport network optimisation; asset tracking and emergency response. One emerging but untapped area is indoor tracking technology. It is in its early stages of 40ABOVEURA PLANNERS PRESENT THE CITYENGINE TOOL AT THE ESRI INTERNATIONAL USER CONFERENCE IN 2014.application but offers the opportunity to holistically optimise environments; creating fully integrated; intelligent spaces – a true ‘white space’ for urban planners and developers.Meaningful data sources can be made readily available to the community to empower citizens to also develop solutions – be they via smart maps or smart apps. How can smart mapping help address real urban issues?Governments in various cities have leveraged on GIS technology to lower carbon emissions; better allocate medical services; manage the delivery of water and energy; reduce commute times and even connect people via ride-share apps. In Los Angeles; for example; GIS technology is being used to involve communities in the transformation of city streetscapes to improve neighbourhood liveability. Meanwhile; here in Singapore; smart mapping is underpinning planning and development activities. There are also countless instances where smart maps have been leveraged on to alert authorities of crimes in progress; an unfolding natural disaster and urgent public works. In each instance; the source of information has been concerned citizens. What are potential pitfalls to watch for? While there are many benefits in using smart maps; there are two key areas that require careful navigation. Firstly; when developing a smart mapping application; it is essential to use quality; optimised data. You can have the most sophisticated GIS technology in the world; but if your data is unreliable or compromised; any application produced would be worthless or (in extreme cases) potentially dangerous. Secondly; it is integral to marry smart mapping technology with the skills and knowledge of GIS professionals and experienced planners. It takes great people to drive great technology. Like any technology platform; the value of its output relies heavily on the information input into the system and the skills of the parties who configure it.

This helps free up more space above ground for other uses like housing; parks and community spaces that contribute to quality living environments.In Singapore; the priority remains to place uses such as rail lines; utilities; warehousing and storage facilities underground. There are no plans for underground homes. The latest infrastructure to be located underground is Singapore’s first 230kV underground substation at the former Pasir Panjang Power District; as announced by National Development Minister; Lawrence Wong on 30 May 2018. Building on current efforts; URA is working with various agencies and partners to further tap on 3D technology and smart data for more holistic and comprehensive planning of underground spaces in Singapore. The aims are to be able to accurately identify and understand the more intricate underground conditions prior to development works; to establish potential obstacles and constraints that can be addressed and to develop detailed visual information and accurate data for more advance planning. By 2019; URA will release a 3D underground master plan for selected pilot areas. Singapore’s key underground efforts and ideas were presented in Urban Lab’s exhibition; “Underground: Singapore’s Next Frontier”; in collaboration with agencies and the industry from 30 May to 29 June 2018. Urban Lab is a URA platform that presents the latest R&D and urban solutions for a future-ready city.

Writer Jennifer EvelandA megacity with a population of over 10 million and counting; it’s a wonder that Seoul is so liveable. The South Korean capital faces the same problems of larger cities worldwide: rapid population growth; ageing districts and an ageing citizenry; and all of the economic; environmental; health and social issues that seem to go hand-in-hand with urbanisation. However; what sets Seoul apart is its approach. In Seoul; urban development is as much about building social cohesion as it is about building infrastructure; and many credit the success of this approach to the city’s Mayor; Park Won-soon.Elected in 2011 under the slogan “Citizens are the Mayor;” Mayor Park has been described as “on a mission to revolutionise the policy-making process.” His passion is participatory democracy; which he has promoted tirelessly since the mid-1990s through his roles as a lawyer; civic activist and founder of community-based non-profit organisations. Now; as the head of the city’s government; Mayor Park has ushered in a new era of government transparency and citizen involvement.We catch up with Mayor Park on his dedication to place citizens at the centrestage of the city’s urban transformation and why this works. AboveFrom the top; the Sewoon Shopping Centre is a result of 7 commercial mega-blocks transformed into a vibrant Makercity; many streets have been activated with pianos and other activities; the Mapo Oil Tank Cultural Park; an eco-friendly cultural centre was crafted from the remains of a fuel storage facility and a part of Cheonggyecheon; a key green haven in the city (far right). Photo credits: Seoul Metropolitan Government and URA.06You have a very unique leadership style.What is the most important aspect of leadership for a megacity such as Seoul?Mobilising the citizens is the most important part of leadership. I was formerly an activist in the civil society; but when I moved into city government; I realised that the sense of leadership is not so different. Empowering the citizens is important to make all policies successful. So I was always emphasising how to mobilise and engage the citizens in our process of decision-making on all policies. That is the number one essential part of leadership.Another important role of leadership is to focus on the future. I’m always saying that the direction is more important than the speed. We Koreans are very much accustomed to speed. We accomplished rapid economic growth since the 1960s; but now focusing on the right direction is important not only for leaders; but also for society in general. I think that understanding global trends and how they will affect future generations is important; so that is why I focus on sustainability; climate change; public transportation; public housing; quality of life; air quality and so on. These are the assets of the future.I think to accomplish anything it is also important to make one team. Teamwork andteam spirit is not confined to the staff of the government; it can also expand to the citizenry. Sharing our vision with citizens is important for discussions and openness; supported by public education to solve our challenges.07AboveMayor Park at a citizen engagement session in Seoul (top image) and Cheonggyecheon; a key project that saw the demolition of highways to create public spaces. The space has become a green haven in the middle of the city.Photo credit: Seoul Metropolitan Government08projects to competitions around the world. We can now see a clear change in the aesthetic quality of our urban architecture.Of the many initiatives you have carried out; what is one improvement you are most proud of? The growth of the citizens. In the past; citizens were regarded as the target or customers for city government; but now they are becoming themayors of the city. Their ideas and their activities are becoming real in the city; implemented through the participatory system with the government.Since my inauguration; I advanced many local community projects; sharing city projects; social enterprises; social economy projects and many new innovative projects and policies. Now 6 years into my term; all the different sectors of policy are becoming 1 brand; transforming Seoul into a new future society and city. Park’s interview responses have been edited and condensed. Park has been the Mayor of Seoul since October 2011. He’s also the President of ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability since 2015 and a board member of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy. Before taking office as Mayor of Seoul; Park worked as a human rights lawyer and was at the very centre of the democracy and human rights movement in Korea. He is a strong proponent of going beyond national borders and strengthening city-to-city cooperation when striving to tackle the many different challenges that the world as a whole faces together. How is your approach different from city governments in the past?Before; we experienced an authoritarian approach for a long time; with a top-down style fixed into every corner of policy decisions and the policy making process. This new bottom-up style is really a fundamental change. I made the decision to change the old negative system into a positive one in terms of disclosure of documents; information and data; to allow citizens to make decisions for themselves. I believe we should disclose everything to citizens and provide a universal platform for them to make their own proposals or to discuss or decide. So from this process we developed a system of citizen participation.How would you describe your approach to urban development? The lives of the citizens are complex. Rather than focusing on big projects only; we can approach many smaller projects instead. I always emphasise that there is nothing trivial in relation with citizens’ lives. And if we have an accumulation of several things together; then revolutionary change can be made. Of course; we have many large projects that focus on rejuvenation; developing new buildings and implementing transport-related initiatives; but in addition to hardware projects; the softer aspects are also important. I really tried to change not only the apparent physical things but also the process and mentality of the many softer; process related things. What can other megacities learn from Seoul? In the past; we didn’t spend money to design good residential buildings; but we are now focusing more on good design. We designated one city architect to oversee every project and enlisted more than 100 young architects to examine building designs at the preliminary stages; opening up architectural 09Citizen participation:the soul of SeoulFor decades; South Korea has enjoyed stellar economic prosperity; resulting in an urban development fixation on quantitative expansion. In the 1970s; the city demolished a lot of its urban heritage to accommodate freeways; parking lots and high rises; while in the 1980s; thecity deregulated building-to-land ratios; floor ratios and usage restrictions in the lead up to the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. But with the new millennium came a shift in the urban development focus; with greater emphasis on sustainable development and the preservation of Seoul’s built heritage;and more recently the transformationhas been led by city residents themselves. Here are some highlights: The 2030 Seoul PlanA collaboration between citizens’ groups; city council members; experts; city government officials and other stakeholders; this 2013 draft paved the course for the city’s future; categorised by key issues; and containing spatial structure and land use plans; regional plans and action plans. The process saw the formation of the Seoul Plan Citizens’ Group; 100 citizens who were tasked with identifying the vision and key tasks for the city. The plan was also reviewed at public hearings and regional presentation sessions. Open government 2.0The M-Voting smartphone app invites citizens to vote almost daily on municipal issues; which in turn provide the city with data to improve services. The Open Information Communication Plaza website shares city documents with the public; while the Seoul Open Data Plaza maintains an open data platform where virtually all quantitative datasets; except for confidential or personal data; is shared freely to educate the public of municipal affairs and invite people to develop their own apps to help address issues. Seoul innovation bureauThe first of its kind in Asia; this multi-departmental innovation unit employs a staff of 58 supported by a budget of [5 mil GBP]; its purpose is to seek insight and ideas from the public; many of which are adopted into policy. A massive civic-engagement undertaking with two goals: to draw citizens into the decision-making process; including budget decisions; and to transform government organisational culture. Among other initiatives; the bureau operates an online portal and hosts interactive workshops between residents and government to seek feedback on important issues. Urban regenerationIn 2017; there were 131 active urban development projects underway in Seoul; driven by a citizen-led process that focuses on urban regeneration; or development without demolition; as opposed to redevelopment. Some of the finest examples to come out of this approach are the Sewoon Shopping Centre; the transformation of 7 1970s commercial mega-blocks into a vibrant Makercity; and the Mapo Oil Tank Cultural Park; an eco-friendly cultural centre crafted from the remains of a circa 1978 emergency fuel storage facility. Sharing city SeoulSince 2012; a new culture is emerging based on the sharing of resources and services. It started with the city government itself sharing facilities such as unused parking lots; empty rooms and idle public spaces with citizens in a bid to help residents; startups and established companies build and capitalise on shared resources. This has spurred a sharing sensibility among citizens; who are encouraged to develop apps to further share services and resources that will help the city andits communities.10About the PrizeThe Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize(LKYWCP) honours outstanding achievements and contributions to the creations of liveable; vibrant and sustainable urban communities around the world.

Writer Dawn LimLeonard Ng Leonard’s design interest lies at the intersection of man and his environment with the aim of finding a long term sustainable balance between them. His approach involves extensive collaboration with diverse professions to develop holistic landscape-based solutions that engage and educate users while respecting the environment. Amongst his many projects; he has led the redesign of the popular Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park that was awarded the President’s Design Award ‘Design of the Year’ in 2012. Look Boon Gee and Ng Sor HiangThrough clever and intimate site-specific strategies;Boon Gee and Sor Hiang have been exploring ways to make living more enjoyable for the people. A personal desire for beautiful open spaces quietly permeates LOOK Architects’ sensitive design approach; which seeks to understand the needs of people while minimising the impact on nature. Boon Gee is also a recipient of the President’s Design Award ‘Designer of the Year’ in 2009.The more urbanised a city; the more contested its spaces. Balancing different needs increasingly becomes a juggling act. How then can we continue to turn spaces into places where people want tolive in?URA planners are envisioning future neighbourhoods to have fewer cars; well connected; inclusive spaces and closer integration with nature for new precincts such as Kampong Bugis; Holland Plain and Bayshore. Co-founders of LOOK Architects; Look Boon Gee and Ng Sor Hiang; and Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl Singapore’s studio director; Leonard Ng; discuss a more nuanced approach to adaptable and inclusive living spaces; and how we can tap into the relationships between individuals; communities and the natural environment.How has Singapore progressed in shaping its living environment? Leonard: Singapore has always emphasised landscaping and quality environments as part of liveability; even though it might not have been defined in these terms before. This principle has largely remained; but I think it has deepened. We are looking at landscape more programmatically now with significant steps taken towards diverse and thoughtful forms of landscaping. We are thinking: What can landscape do for people? What can landscape do for nature? AboveThe Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park by Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl (image above) has won many hearts with its multi-layered design that balances functional; ecological and communal needs while LOOK Architect’s Trans-Urban Connector Project in Fuzhou (image on the right); China; seeks to draw closer the relationship between people; city and the mountains. Photo credit: Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl and LOOK Architects 14There is more than ever a need to share; and for residential developments to shift people’s mindsets from ‘not in my backyard’ to ‘good in my backyard’.How do you ensure different needs are met in a residential project?Boon Gee; Sor Hiang: We think that there is morethan ever a need to share; and for residential developments to shift people’s mindsets from ‘not in my backyard’ to ‘good in my backyard’. We have a public housing project; St. George’s Tower; where the drop off and precinct pavilion is integrated into an active ageing hub. Instead of tucking the elderlies in a corner; we want them to partake in the goings-on. But a facility like this may generate mixed responses from residents; so we set a really nice pavilion within a nice ageing facility. We want to show that it is alright to share.How else does St. George’s Tower encourage sharing?Boon Gee; Sor Hiang: We tried to boost opportunities for interaction between residents and non-residents through these unique pockets of sky terraces withinthe residential blocks. The idea is to encourage an upward flow of movement so that activities are not confined to the ground. The blocks have such a spectacular view of the city; why not share it? The precinct pavilion and landscaping on the ground floor also faces the park connector; encouraging non-residents to take a detour into the developmentor continue their Kallang-Whampoa Heritage Trail. Will we have fenceless condominiums in Singapore some day?Boon Gee; Sor Hiang: Maybe we still have some way to go. But in the meantime; there are always friendlier strategies to distinguish a private development without saying: “I am here and you are there”. The idea of the street is very important. You want to maintain privacy and still respect the streetscape. We designed a condominium; Bliss@Kovan; where the perimeter wall is set behind the drop-off porch. This makes the entire frontage with its paved driveway look like it belongs to the street; even though it belongs to the condominium. We also employed very porous fencing all around so that the condominium’s landscaping can be visually enjoyed from the outside. 15their imagination. This is increasingly anew approach. What is an attractive living environmentto you?Leonard: If we can coexist with nature; if all the parks are high quality and accessible; if people learn to use these valuable spaces sensitively;I think that will be wonderful. Right now; we still don’t understand what all these spaces really mean. We see them as amenities for our use. But they are more than amenities – they are our heritage and nature’s heritage. If we never understand what makes a space special; it will lead to big impediments for future advancements. Boon Gee; Sor Hiang: We long for open; green spaces and vast stretches of untouched; unbuilt spaces. For us; nature is also a great treasure trove of ideas and inspiration. The forest walk we designed in Alexandra was inspired by the ‘mile-a-minute’ plant. We will prefer to preserve whatever little natural heritage we have; but if green spaces must be touched; any intervention must be very sensitive.Other ideas you have been exploring lately? Boon Gee; Sor Hiang: We have been intrigued by this idea of slow walking as a basic human activity that could make city living more enjoyable. This is what we explored for our Trans-Urban Connector project in Fuzhou; China. The intention is to draw closer the relationship between people; city and the ever present mountains in Fuzhou. So we proposed an eco-smart walkway system that cuts through an inaccessible mountainous area; creating new vantage points and a thoroughfare for people to get from city to mountain; from one place to another. Future neighbourhoodsPlans for Kampong Bugis; Holland Plain and Bayshore; were announced in October 2017. A total of 19;000 housing units are in the pipeline for the 3 precincts in the next decade. They will be designed around the vision of a car-lite; inclusive and green future. For more information on these precincts; go to ura.sg/futurehoods.How can we better integrate our social and ecological infrastructure? Leonard: Instead of building in the image of man; we can think about working with nature; harnessing its ideas for more enriching and efficient designs. But this means we will need to return to the first principles of natural systems and learn what makes nature work. The least we can do is respond to topography; identify high-value trees to retain; and try not to change the land too much (lest it goes against our storm flow). What does adaptability encompass in landscape design? Leonard:We call it a “future-forward design”. It involves planning and design with a view to the future where an entire urban fabric will change. For example; in our CleanTech Park project for JTC; not all the (currently forested) plots will be developed concurrently. So we developed the green-blue infrastructure in the centre first and prepared agreen corridor. When all the plots are occupied inthe future; animals can migrate into this corridorand start using it.How do you go about finding the most inclusive perspective?Leonard: We always design in layers. A park design is many things – biophilic design; stormwater management; landscape design. You think about the water; the plants; the animals and the people. We try to plan for different age groups; but we accept that we can’t possibly know what everybody wants. Hence; we create interesting areas that are not programmed; and people can colonise them with 16AboveThe approach to the Jurong eco-garden within the CleanTech Park is to focus on maintaining a sustainable balance between the development’s commercial needs and the site’s natural biodiversity.

This is changing work spaces in significant ways. Writer Jennifer Eveland Photographer Chee Boon Pin There is a curious office space in the Sandcrawler Building; deep in the heart of Fusionopolis; a research and development complex in Singapore’s one-north business park. Workers here wear jeans and trainers and sit wherever they please; alone or in groups; near the well-stocked open pantry or the playful chill-out area; gazing out at sweeping views or hanging out on the lush open-air terrace. A casual observer might think this is the office of Lucasfilms; or maybe Google or Facebook; but surprisingly it is a bank. DBS; to be exact.This office exemplifies a growing trend for companies to bust up their boxy cubicles in favour of spaces that are open; flexible and adaptablefor mixed-use; holistic environments designed togear up their workers; and their businesses; as theyblaze a trail into uncertain futures within fast-changing industries.With the advent of new technologies; traditional industries are being disrupted; some beyond recognition. Commercial banking is not immune. As app developers build competitive web-based options for global payments; remittance; lending and other financial transactions; traditional banks are at risk of becoming merely data platforms from which these third-party companies operate. But for banks clever enough to harness emerging technologies; the opportunities are endless. AboveThis is the office of DBS Asia X; the bank’s innovation hub located at Fusionpolis. The 16;000 square feet office is made up of mostly open spaces and other breakout spots. 17According to Steyn Verhoeven; a consultant at Zanders Treasury & Finance Solutions; banks need to become more like Google or Apple; lest Google or Apple become the next bank. In a 2016 think piece; he wondered; “With the world’s largest taxi company owning no vehicles; and the world’s most popular media owner creating no content; perhaps in the future; the world’s largest bank will not even hold deposits?”“Banks are no longer competing with other banks;” says Annie Ye; head of DBS Asia X; or DAX; the innovation hub that occupies this unique space at Fusionopolis. “Technology companies like Alibaba; Tencent; Baidu plus fintech start-ups are all coming into our space and providing fast; cheap and scalable service. So we have to look at our playground in a very different way;” she says.DAX is just one of DBS’s responses to the sea change; a place where the bank can engage the fintech community and breed a culture of innovation. Residents; or DAXters; consist of about 70 per cent DBS employees from across different teams in the bank; while the rest are a mash-up of fintech startups; social enterprises and student interns. Opened in late 2016; DAX ran up to 14 internal innovation projects in 2017; driven by various business units within the bank. DAXter teams conceive of products; services or processes with the goal of developing a successful proof-of-concept.Fertile ground for ideasIn the centre of the 16;000 square feet of mostly open space; small clusters of tables are surrounded by moveable whiteboards; welcoming collaboration among DAXsters from myriad functions; sectors and disciplines. The vast majority of them don’t even come from a banking background. “The culture of a tech company; the way of working is very different to a bank;” says Annie;“so we need a space like DAX to enable that. The space is about being agile and bringing multidisciplinary functions together; so we have a lot of open space and moveable furniture that facilitates this kind of conversation.”18The future is not just a person working at his desk by himself. It’s a project team; a group effort that we need to build. Because the system that we are building is becoming more complex; integrated and connected. It’s not just one product that we are building; but a system.Here; no one has a permanent desk. Everyone works from any point they choose. Plants hang upside down; giant Lego bricks cordon off breakout spaces and natural light streams in from nearly every angle through panoramic windows. In addition to the pantry; play area and terrace; an auditorium for 200 can be opened up entirely to the rest ofthe space.For DAX; planning programmes is as important as planning space. In 2017; DAX hosted around 220 events; from sleepover hackathons to TEDTalk thought-leadership-style presentations; programmes to inspire both DBS employees and the broader innovation community to view their work beyond traditional boundaries. Many events reach out to innovators within start-ups; fintech and social enterprise communities; their Sandcrawler Building and one-north neighbours; like Disney and GovTech.“What’s most important is the community we create. We can curate this space so that people come here to learn; collaborate; grow their network and receive support;” says Annie. But for all the fun; DAX means serious business; positioned to change the mindsets and empower 26;000 DBS employees to become a 26;000-person start-up; which is why Annie says they chose a Fusionopolis address. “You need a space away from the traditional financial district so that people feel they can do things differently. This is a safe place to experiment and fail fast. They are safe to try new things here. They don’t have to think about returns on investment; because that’s not how people start the problem solving process;” says Annie.But she doesn’t see this as the end of the financial district in a traditional sense. “I don’t see it disappearing;” says Annie. “But we can think about the future of the district; possibly for education; access to more people in need; and social enterprises. There is an opportunity to give it a new meaning and function given how technology is evolving.”AboveAnnie Ye; head of DBS Asia X at one of the informal spaces in the office (image on the left) at Fusionpolis and a booth within the Continental Automotive office in Singapore for smaller; private conversations. 19Affecting everyone; everywhereAcross town; another company in a completely different industry has also redesigned its workspace in anticipation of a future driven by new technology. Later in 2018; Continental Automotive Singapore will be rolling out a new R&D facility that is completely unlike the company’s 2 existing blocks at Boon Keng Road.“We are moving towards more electric and software driven; integrated products; things like automated vehicles and artificial intelligence;”saysLo Kien Foh; managing director of German automotive solutions provider; Continental Automotive Singapore. As a result; he says; engineers focus less on mechanical parts than they used to and more on software development. Continental Automotive Singapore is the R&D hub under Continental Corporation; one of the world’s top automotive suppliers and the Singapore location is home to one of Continental’s largest R&D centres in Asia. “We’ve made the new building future-ready; more flexible so that we’re able to adapt easily. It is definitely more open;” says Kien Foh.In the new facility; the open plan design encourages workers to mix with each other to talk about their projects. Each floor has a central meeting space with a large screen monitor and glass walls that can be moved to form a number of sizes and configurations for discussions. It is in these spaces that the company holds kanban; a Japanese practice of brief daily updates of ongoing projects. In other areas; smaller alcoves with monitors have been created for smaller stand-up meetings. Each floor also has a number of sound-proofed rooms for teleconferencing and small booths to facilitate private conversations between2 or 3 people.“The future is not just a person working at his desk by himself;” says Kien Foh. “It’s a project team; a group effort that we need to build. Why? Because the system that we are building is becoming more complex; integrated and connected. It’s not just one product that we are building; but a system. Moving into the future; things won’t be as simple anymore.”20AboveBoth Continental Automotive (image on the left) and DBS Asia X’s offices (image on the right) are designed with more open; flexible and adaptable spaces to allow for different types of discussions; collaborations and working styles. Technology shifts have even altered individual workstations; which can be raised or lowered hydraulically to suit increasingly small and lightweight automotive parts and the equipment used to make and test them.Aesthetics is also a surprising factor in the new facility; with a focus on bright colours; natural light and even a spacious leisure space with a billiards table to create a more vibrant and stimulating work environment. Employee programmes also promote work life balance. Things like fruit snacks; sport recreation clubs and a community garden promote healthy lifestyles and welcome breaks from thedaily grind.It goes without saying that such measuresare also intended to attract top talent. “How canwe make ourselves the employer of choice?” says Kien Foh. “By creating a work environment where people feel at home and feel like they can accomplish what they want to do.”Future districtsAt a district level; planners are also creating more open and adaptable spaces that encourage collaborations and the fostering of thriving communities in future precincts like the Jurong Lake District and Punggol Digital District. In Jurong Lake District; a regular grid system for land parcels offers flexibility in providing larger or smaller land parcels to meet different needs. A ‘white’ zoning in the business area enables landlords and tenants to mix various uses and adapt spaces for future needs. The district is also envisioned to support more sustainable mobility set amidst green and blue spaces. At Punggol Digital District; the new 50-ha development in Punggol North announced in January 2018 will become Singapore’s first Enterprise District driven by technology and innovation. It will also be the first district in Singapore to adopt an integrated master plan approach that combines amenities for the community with a business park and a university – the Singapore Institute of Technology. This opens up interactions between students; researchers and industrialists for a more dynamic business environment.21N E I G H B O U R H O O D S /P L A YHow we play3 creative leaders reflect on their play memories growing up and the types of play spaces they wish for in the city.Writer Dawn LimMARK WEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DESIGNSINGAPORE COUNCILThe idea of play is a richly layered one. It refers to spaces where there is a sense of ownership and contribution to urban life. As an artist and architect; I loved my office in Arab Street. There were always a variety of food options; cool spaces and businesses in the neighbourhood. In my new role at DesignSingapore; play is something I have been contemplating in our aspiration to shape a loveable city by design. Just as we are shaped by our environments; we can also shape the places in which we live; work and play. The concept of play for me is to have places where I can go to; be filled with wonder; feel the generosity of the creative human spirit and contribute through different actions. Playing as a childGrowing up in Serangoon Gardens; I spent mydays hanging out; skateboarding or playing basketball with my friends. But the most memorable times were our secret group adventures. We would explore on our bicycles; catch fish in canals;sneak out in the middle of the night; and got backhome before our parents woke up. I believe these times are responsible for shaping me and my creative leanings.Playing as a grown-upWhat I enjoy doing now is going to East Coast Park and cycling around the Joo Chiat area. The openness of the park gives me a space to stare out into the sea; allowing me to think and reflect. The eclectic nature of Joo Chiat and the scale of the shophouses also yield unexpected discoveries now and then. Playing in the cityI met a travelling street artist from London at East Coast Park some weeks ago. I asked him for his first impression of Singapore. He said that although it was a beautiful city; everything seemed in place; like they couldn’t be touched or contributed to. No doubt; there is good design all around us; but more of our environment can be framed in an open-ended manner; where the public feels inspired to touch and play; to design their own experiences using various mediums. Playing in the future We all can curate the type of creative energy that we wish for a place. I would like to see places that can be easily adapted or reconfigured for different community needs. These places need not be completely designed; and only made complete by the public’s contributions. An artist; architect; experience designer and educator; Mark Wee is currently the executive director ofthe DesignSingapore Council. He was also recently named one of Singapore’s “20 under 45” architects by URA. In his professional life; Mark believes in shaping places that deepen identity and community; as well as the potential of design and innovation for business and cultural transformation.22AboveThis illustration by Mark Wee was inspired by Clara Chow’s book; “Dream Storeys”; published in 2016; presenting a series of fictional stories about Singapore. Places were reimagined as extraordinary spaces. For example; multi-storey carparks became landscaped gardens; buildings were built around majestic trees and Bukit Timah hill became a colourful; cheerful mosaic of a climb.23JACKSON TAN CREATIVE DIRECTOR BLACKIn the city; play is commonly or universally seen as entertainment. Mobile gaming on the train; playing pool at the bar or a game of frisbees at the park – they are all activities that entertain and engage the individuals in our everyday lives. Playing as a childWhen I was a kid; my maternal grandparents lived in a Housing Development Board flat in Dakota. I have fond memories of playing with my cousins in this family home. Our extended family members have a tradition of meeting over the weekends for home-cooked dinners in this very house. After eating; all the children get to go out and play. In a familiar scene; the adults sit around and chat while the kids have a field day on swings; the see-saws and other playground rides. Our play and activities were simple; but the joy came from being together with the cousins and knowing that we did not have to go to school the next day.Playing as a grown-upPlay these days comprises post-work and post-dinner futsal with a bunch of friends on weekday nights. Long walks on weekends with my wife are also valued time. When we are up to it; we sometimes invite friends over for a homely nightof board games.Playing in the cityAs a small city and island-state; play spaces can be built around our lives (home) and work (office); so that opportunities for play is always situated nearby. They should be made inspiring and accessible. If we repurpose some of the old or underutilised places around the city into play spaces – however big or small – they can easily become play destinations. Playing in the future Most people might cite the future as one that will be based indoors; shaped by virtual reality or digital-technology-enabled. However; I hope for future playscapes that are even more experiential; physical; outdoor-oriented and integrated with nature. These play spaces can be designed for kids as well as adults – where grown-ups are encouraged to play and our inner child-like wonders are ignited so that we can all return to the simple joys of playing.Jackson Tan is an artist; designer and curator. He is the creative director of BLACK; a multidisciplinary creative agency and founding partner of PHUNK; a contemporary art & design collective. Jackson was awarded ‘Designerof the Year’ in 2007 by the President’s Design Award.24up stories and playing them out. I interacted with my environment; swinging from Banyan trees and playing with huge fallen palm leaves. Playing as a grown-upNow; I am drawn to connections beyond my immediate environment; to explore possibilities beyond my circumstances. I enjoy travelling and connecting with people; and experiencing fascinating cultures from Tao Pueblos to the Berbers and the Nias Islanders. I also turn towards playing through my work.Playing in the cityPlay in a fast-paced modern city like Singapore would mean to explore within our means and to push the boundaries of the free market. It is free from constraints such as the cost of living; power imbalances and historical baggage – yet; it works with the culture; geography and materials available. Here; play is spontaneous; unpredictable and can take the shape of organised chaos. It is a vessel for serendipitous encounters and all kinds of opinions and weirdness to free people’s minds from the expected. Playing in the future In Georg Simmel’s “The Metropolis and The Mental Life”; cities of the near future will be in constant motion; with a high fluidity of information; commodities and population. The material of the city will transform dramatically into more complex; flexible organisations and soft (digital and ecological) infrastructures.As cities move towards digital infrastructure; children will move from playing with sandpits to playing with roadside LED sculptures. With analogue mobile apps; they will code and hack themselves into cities to create their own narratives of play. My idea of play spaces in the future is anti-design. It grows out of the inherent resourcefulness of children and their non-conformity to rules. Intrigued by the world of visuals; Clara began illustrating since young. She has since grown to experimenting and collaborating in diverse fields ranging from fashion prints to weaving spatial interventions and stage design using multiple disciplines as mediums for storytelling. She is a Forbes Asia inaugural 30 under 30 honouree and co-founder of nomadic creative house – in the wild.CLARA YEE CREATIVE DIRECTOR IN THE WILDIn the context of spatial relationships; play breaks stereotypes and calls upon our imaginations to envision futures ahead of us. It is an inherent quality we were born with. Taking on various instances and qualities over our growing years; play evolves with us and so do the spaces surrounding us. A child might feel powerful and free in a playground; confidently hanging off monkey bars; an adult may discover more fun with setting foot on foreign land and bringing ideas into reality. In some ways; we are living the playful dreams of ancestors; and it is now our turn to play; shape and transform. Playing as a childImmersed in my immediate environment of lalang fields; drains and the Bidadari cemetery; I take trips down my imagination; miming props; making Above and oppositeThis illustration by Clara Yee envisions a future city on higher ground that patches over infrastructure meant for automation and data highways. In the small pockets of spaces between these infrastructures; people create their own disposable playgrounds with materials such as cheap discarded LED tubes; pocket projectors and etc. It’s disposable meets DIY culture. This illustration (left) by Jackson Tan is inspired by his childhood memories of playing at animal themed playgrounds at his grandparents’ old flat at Dakota. He envisions future playgrounds to be fusing with the cityscape that has colourful and fun-filled activities surrounded by beautiful nature.25I N S I G H T /A G E I N G F R I E N D L Y N E I G H B O U R H O O D SAgeing and social capitalAcademics; designers and policy makers are coming together in a seminal project to develop planning and design guidelines for ageing friendly neighbourhoods in Singapore. Writer Jennifer Eveland Photographer Chee Boon Pin When referring to an age-friendly neighbourhood; we should use the word “ageing friendly” instead; suggests Dr Belinda Yuen; the research director and programme lead of the Lee Li Ming Programme in Ageing Urbanism at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities; Singapore University Technology and Design (SUTD). “Ageing is a process whereas age denotes a label. Ageing is not the end of life; instead; there is a lot to celebrate as one moves on to later years.”She is leading a seminal 18-month research project that started from July 2017; seeking to understand the connection between the neighbourhood’s built environment and older persons’ social; physical and mental health. For this project; SUTD is also joined by the Geriatric Education & Research Institute; which will provide research on the public health and medical needs of ageing Singaporeans.Envisioning an ideal ageing friendly neighbourhood; Belinda says it should be welcoming (inclusive for all); walkable; wonderful (with attractive spaces) and warm (referring to human interactions). “Our task is clear;” says Belinda; “to provide the opportunities that encourage older people to get out of the house and to support them in their capacity to use the spaces around them; otherwise they may become housebound. The physical infrastructure and facilities are very important in providing the stage for activities to play out and opportunities for interaction that can help address loneliness and social isolation.” Something as simple as a bench can become critical. Belinda suggests that benches placed in public spaces in Singapore should be made of materials that are relevant to the local climate; that are comfortable and have arm rests for older people to use to lift themselves up. Placement is also important; along common paths and at short intervals. Even the angles at which they are placed make a difference; as benches facing each otherare more conducive for social interaction. Based on the project scope; Belinda and her team will focus on 3 neighbourhoods with different population profiles; topography; and land use mix; to provide local quantitative and qualitative insights. They have also undertaken benchmark comparisons with other ageing-friendly initiatives in 10 cities around the world.Dream projectOnce the research is completed; it will be used to produce broad planning and design guidelines that can be applied to existing and future neighbourhoods. There may also be opportunities to do post-implementation evaluation of subsequent improvements made within the 3 selected neighbourhoods. For this reason; Belinda calls it a “dream project.”“Singapore is the first to approach the issue of ageing-friendly neighbourhoods from research through intervention prototyping to evaluation;”says Belinda. The project brings together academics; policy makers and architects. Funded by the National Research Foundation and Ministry of 26AboveThe seminal study by URA on ageing friendly neighbourhood is looking more closely at shaping and designing engaging spaces for older persons; including places like Coffee Corner at Toa Payoh View; a social gathering space initiated by local champion Philip Phajan Singh (image at the top) and Toa Payoh West market and its surrounding spaces that have become a focal point for many in the neighbourhood. 27An explicit goal of ageing friendly design is to make sure that people’s life space mobility doesn’t get constricted; the amount that someone is willing and feels enabled to travel beyond their immediate home environment.National Development (under L2NIC) and ledby URA; some other partners include the Ministryof Health; Building & Construction Authority;Agency for Integrated Care and Housing & Development Board.Her team is producing up to 10 deliverables; including an environmental audit toolkit which can be used by planners; architects; local councils or even residents themselves to assess the ageing-friendliness of their neighbourhood spaces. A draft has already been presented to some Town Councils for feedback.Design solutions The project also includes 3 architectural firms; CPG Corporation; Tierra Design and Lekker Architects. Each firm has been assigned to focus on 1 of the 3 neighbourhoods identified as part of the project;and come up with context specific design solutions. “An explicit goal of ageing friendly design is to make sure that people’s life space mobility doesn’t get constricted; the amount that someone is willing and feels enabled to travel beyond their immediate home environment;” says co-founder of Lekker Architects Ong Ker-Shing. This means walkability; benches and places that inspire social interaction are high on her list of priorities. Wayfinding is another. “These days; everything shouts for your attention;” she says. “There’s no quiet fabric that forms the background; similar to what you see in older cities. With redevelopment; it’s hard to have a neighborhood that is both legible in the scale of the buildings and the neighborhood itself; while retaining recognisable landmarks. That’s confusing as you get older; when maybe you forget things or find a lot of information hard to sift out. So one thing we’ve wondered is whether there can be a simplification of the visual information at a neighborhood level.”Tierra Design’s co-founder Franklin Po adds: “The dilemma is to understand the neighborhood and the flows of where people are walking and then to figure out where all the spots are that need to be fixed.” If it were up to him; Franklin says he would do away with every step and level change within the main walkways of the neighbourhood and move all roads and parking to peripheral areas; creating a seamless corridor of green and open spaces that is safe and inclusive for everyone. For exercise; there should be pathways outside of these main pathways to give people more choices.Social capitalSimilar to Belinda and Ker-Shing; Franklin places importance on how people use their neighbourhood spaces to form social connections; observing how residents gravitate to some spaces more than others; and the various ways that spaces are used for ad hoc activities. “Remember; people used to live in kampongs at the ground level;” says Franklin; “so when you put them in apartment blocks; you’ve changed the social fabric. We want to bring people out from their apartments; back down to the ground level. It’s a big issue if people don’t want to mingle or don’t even know who their neighbours are.”28He adds: “We are exploring the difference between designing spaces for people and designing spaces for people to create by themselves;” says Franklin. “We feel that if we give ownership to people; not just the elderly but people of all ages; then they will actually use these spaces more often.” It’s about building social capital. “What we’re trying to do in communities is to build social cohesion and providing amenities that will actually promote people coming together with different interests and to find the kind of interest thatthey like.”AboveOlder persons within the Toa Payoh View neighbourhood have re-purposed common public spaces into their own gathering spots like this one (images on the left and right). These are located close to the Toa Payoh West market (image at the top). 29See you at Coffee CornerAn example of what it means to build social capital lies with a quiet local champion. He has inspired both Belinda and Franklin in what he is doing at Toa Payoh View; building up an enviable community spirit; an important aspect in contributing to thriving ageing friendly neighbourhoods.Every Saturday morning; Philip Phajan Singh; project chairman at the Toa Payoh View Residents’ Committee (RC) has been creating quite a stir amongst residents who stream out of their homes and into the courtyard outside the RC office to enjoy coffee and breakfast together. There are also other things to do – join an exercise class; attend an informative talk or even go for a medical check-up. Philip is one of the founders of the weekly Coffee Corner space. Organising a simple gathering each week has begun to build indelible bonds among neighbours and inspired heart-warming stories. It was at this place that 2 people who had lived in the same block for 40 years met each other for the first time and became friends. It was also here that a 96-year-old woman who lived in seclusion; wheelchair-and house-bound; found friends to talk to. And every week; a group of 8 elderly gentlemen can be seen setting up a table for their regular session of an informal men’s club. 30AbovePhilip Phajan Singh (featured in the images on the left and right) at Coffee Corner at Toa Payoh View; which he started in 2016; an informal space that has attracted 200 people every week. A health post is run by National Health Care Groups. All of the bread; rolls and pastries are provided gratis by Bread Line; a bakery located just across the street. Volunteers show up every Friday night to transport donations to the RC office for the following morning. On the impact of Coffee Corner; Philip says: “People look forward to coming. They get a lot out of it; benefitting their health and knowledge. It’s more than coffee and tea; that’s for sure. It’s the conversation and sharing. People start caring about each other; and that’s really the whole idea.”A weekly affairPhilip remembers the first Coffee Corner in September 2016. The idea had been to create a monthly event; but after seeing the 80 people who showed up for the first one; Philip was motivated to make it a weekly affair; which he believes is key to its growth and popularity. Now; Coffee Corner welcomes up to 200 attendees of all ages; from all backgrounds - and even some who come from other neighbourhoods - to join the fun each week. A true grassroots effort; Coffee Corner has a wealth of volunteers; from a 10 year-old primary school student to elderly couples who volunteer together; from Singaporeans to expats and new citizens alike. Programmes are provided by a host of agencies; including the Silver Generation Office; Health Promotion Board; Central Singapore Council; Singapore Police Force and the National Environment agency. 31I N S I G H T /P H O T O E S S A YIs Tiong Bahru good for ageing?We walk around the neighbourhood with architect Ong Ker-Shing to find out. Writer Jennifer Eveland and Serene Tng Photographer Chee Boon Pin 3The small hump“There are many things that don’t occur to usbut my mother is pointing this out to me now…it can be as small as this tiny little hump; youcan kind of stub your toe and go tumblingover. In fact; one of my ex-colleagues who is inher late twenties was just walking around hereand she accidentally went like this and shebroke her foot. Perhaps smaller private sector or student-led guerilla projects can explore coming up with design solutions for problems like this; to enable ageing-in-place.”Tiong Bahru; one of Singapore’s first housing estate; is where co-founder of Lekker Architects Ong Ker-Shing’s office is located. We stroll through the neighbourhood to understand how its physical environment might be helpful or harmful forolder persons. 1The scale“What I think this neighborhood does really wellis its scale. You have no choice but to be socialin a place like this and it has to do with its lowrise character. You’re so up close and personalwith other people’s places…and that’s goodfor keeping you engaged;” says Ker-Shing. In addition; the different scales of the places within short distances make the place moreattractive with a range of different environments to access. Ker-Shing also finds moving around Tiong Bahru relatively easy and is highlywalkable. “Prolonged walking throughoutthe day is supposed to be very important tohealthy ageing.”The staircase “This can be intimidating... in the floors above2me; there used to be older couples living there.However; even when they are strugglingwith their shopping bags; they refuse help;” says Ker-Shing.3213233I N S I G H T /P L A C E M A N A G E M E N TThe story of Tanjong PagarTucked in the heart of the business district; this charming enclave has become a vibrant neighbourhood of old and new. How will the story of its past and future continue to be shaped and told? Writer Serene Tng Photographer Chee Boon Pin Tanjong Pagar is a historic district in the heart of the Central Business District. Located between the docks and the town area; it was an enclave for thousands of Chinese and Indian dock workers for many years. In the mid-1980s; Tanjong Pagar was one of the first few areas in Singapore to be gazetted as a conservation area as part of the larger Chinatown district. Today; it is thriving neighbourhood that continues to evolve. With its contrast of old and new; the place offers new opportunities to further strengthen its identity and vitality. Place-making; a coordinated; multi-stakeholder approach to improve districts will play an increasingly important role in enhancing areas like Tanjong Pagar and its distinctive character. We catch up with two active stakeholders of the neighbourhood; Cheng Hsing Yao; group managing director of GuocoLand Singapore; that developed Tanjong Pagar Centre; a new focal point for the district and Justin K Chen; deputy ceo of Arcc Holdings; an investment company that owns many shophouses in the area. They share their memories and hopes for the district and the role of place-making in shaping its future.What are your memories of the neighbourhood?Hsing Yao: There were many dilapidated shophouses in the district until the 1980’s conservation programme that started with a pilot restoration project along Neil Road. I remember it as a quaint area with a mix of shophouses; Housing Development Board flats; offices; shops andhotels. However; it never really had a clear centreor identity.How has Tanjong Pagar evolved?Justin: Tanjong Pagar is coming into its own as a new hub apart from other districts in the city centre such as Raffles Place and Marina Bay. It has avery distinct blend of old and new which sets it apart. The new developments including Tanjong Pagar Centre have helped to give prominence tothe area especially in attracting businesses looking for office space.Hsing Yao: More new offices; malls and hotels have been added in Tanjong Pagar as compared to 10 years ago. The demographics has now become more diverse. The lived-in population is growing. There are more business travellers and tourists here too with more social and sporting activities available. It is definitely a lot more ‘live-work-play’. What role can place-making play for the area?Hsing Yao: The stakeholders in Tanjong Pagar are very diverse; some of whom are very new to the area while others have been here for a very long time. Place management can bring the stakeholders together to foster a greater understanding of the district; and to also work together to make it better. 3435Justin: When things change as quickly as they do in Singapore; it’s challenging for locations to retain a sense of identity just based on a revolving cast of tenants. There has to be a more deliberate focus on building up the heritage of the place. This is one of the advantages of Tanjong Pagar but that also results in a range of different perceptions of the area depending on who you ask. Place-making can help build on this and create compelling; unifying narratives about the place that excites people.What do you hope to see for the area in the coming years? Hsing Yao: I hope to see an improved public realm. We can connect the beautiful linear park at Duxton Plain that leads from Eu Tong Sen to the new urban parks above and around the Tanjong Pagar MRT station. With an enhanced network of public spaces; we can introduce more informal activities in these spaces and explore closures of some of the streets on weekends. It will be wonderful if we can anchor the activities with a unique yearly festival.I hope to also see a more conscious management of the trade mix to introduce more diversity and character in the area. And we can tell better stories of both the heritage of the place and the new things happening here. This way; we can shape the ‘old and new’ identity.Justin: For me; the most exciting changes in Tanjong Pagar has to be the slow return of residential homes to the city centre. There is a vibrancy that comes with a mixed-use precinct; with a diverse range of interactions and activities throughout the span of a day; rather than just during meal times. I personally would love to see Tanjong Pagar become a place people love to live in; to be able to wander your neighbourhood and build a more tangible community. You will not find people who are more passionate about a neighbourhood than those who actually live there.36AboveTanjong Pagar – a contrast of old and new; from the busy Tanjong Pagar Plaza of the 1970s (image at top left) to the active Urban Park at the Tanjong Pagar Centre; a new focal point for the district (image at top right) and the quiet Duxton Plain Park which was previously used for the Singapore-Kranji Railway Line. 3738AboveIn Tanjong Pagar; shophouses are set amidst modern buildings; surrounded by greenery.39Why is there a need for districts like Tanjong Pagar be guided by a more formal place management model? Hsing Yao: The city of Singapore is now quite mature; and there is a tendency for a successful model to be repeated thereby creating possibly a cookie cutter experience. We want the city tohave more distinctive districts that provide a more varied experience. It is hard to achieve that through a top-down process. In other cities; many of the spontaneous ground-up initiatives came about because the district had degenerated to such a dire state that stakeholders had to step up to help themselves. In Singapore; I cannot think of anywhere that is as poorly managed to the same extent. I personally would love to see Tanjong Pagar become a place people love to live in; to be able to wander your neighbourhood and build a more tangible community. You will not find people who are more passionate about a neighbourhood than those who actually live there.There is also an over-reliance on the government Any lesser known places?to provide all the solutions and answers. The place management model is a way to nudge more ground- up initiatives by showing people the potential of what their districts could become. Most of us are new to the processes of place management like forming an association; how to define practical and equitable policies; costing and execution of public events; etc. A formal model administered by an independent party provides a framework for us to engage; establish communication and build trust.What are some of your favourite places inthe area?Hsing Yao: The Urban Park at Tanjong Pagar Centre for the ambience and public activities. Maxwell Market for the food. Duxton Hill because I used to intern there and always remember the beautiful paved street.Justin: One of the joys of the shophouse district is the discovery of interesting pockets when you take the time to wander the streets. My favourite spots are the hidden green belts such as the cobbled street of Duxton Hill; the wide expanse of Duxton Plain and the tree lined path of Ann Siang Park.Hsing Yao: The Tanjong Pagar Plaza. It is an integrated mixed development of the 1970s. Shops surround open air courtyards; and the apartments neatly rise above. Among the shops are many old trades; but also new concept cafes and eateries. About the pilot business improvement districtURA and other agencies have been working closely with stakeholders to implement crucial place-making efforts in Singapore. In the last decade; more private sector stakeholders have taken on active roles with several districts managed by stakeholders for areas like Singapore River; Little India and Kampong Gelam. In September 2017; URA formally launched the pilot Business Improvement District (BID) programme to test the BID framework in Singapore. BID is a legislated place management model commonly used in other cities to create positive impact to a place that benefits its users. Property/business owners vote to implement a business plan for a particular district and everyone is compelled to contribute towards funding the business plan if there is majority support for it. Under this pilot; seed funding is available to support stakeholders in their place management efforts.

It had something to say;” says Kok Hiang. In 2017; his firm; Forum Architects; completed a detailed restoration of the iconic Jurong Town Hall; which has become a significant landmark and symbol of Singapore’s successful industrialisation efforts.Completed in 1974; Jurong Town Hall served as the headquarters of Jurong Town Corporation (currently known as JTC Corporation) formed in 1968 to spearhead industrial growth. A site was chosen atop an 80-foot-long hill commanding sweeping views of the area and a design competition was held in 1969. The winner; selected from 34 entries; was Architects Team 3 led by pioneer architect Datuk Seri Lim Chong Keat; who designed many significant buildings in the 1960s and 1970s including the Singapore Conference Hall.The building’s sense of gravitas comes from its brutalist design; an extension of modern architecture known for massive; unadorned and unpretentious structures built from raw concrete. Lim Chong Keat also added nautical design elements – from the outside; the cantilevered upper storeys gave the building the appearance of a ship’s hull and the tall clock tower; a mast.“Jurong Town Hall is a product of an exceptional period in our history; and its architecture captures the spirit of an era when our pioneer generation was boldly imagining and developing the future of Singapore;” says Ng Lang; CEO of JTC Corporation. “Even today; it stands as an innovative landmark embodying what the JTC spirit stands for.”In 2000; JTC moved to the JTC Summit; and the building was renamed iHub in 2004 to attract start-up technology companies who needed affordable office space. Upper levels were subdivided into many units until 2005; when Jurong Town Hall was gazetted first as a conserved building before it was designated as a national monument in 2015. To peel back the layers of history; Kok Hiangand his team found information and inspirationfrom a surprising source: old copies of the Singapore Institute of Architects Journal which had 42Photography by Darren Sohdetailed coverage of the competition and original photos. He also met a long-time JTC employee; who regaled the team with stories about the old building.The result is a masterpiece that continues to reflect the spirit and essence of the building.The grand entranceVisitors to Jurong Town Hall enter an airy square concourse atrium; the building’s focal point. From high above; natural sunlight streams through a glass ceiling; illuminating glossy white stucco walls and marble floors buffed to a mirror finish. Surprisingly; the marble is original; says Kok Hiang; a testament to using quality building materials.Overhead; the upper floors appear stacked in cantilevered tiers; creating a visual effect that emphasises horizontal lines; which Kok Hiang explains is typical of the original architect’s design aesthetic. Kok Hiang referenced this aesthetic when he created the thin horizontal brass strip that runs along all four walls of the concourse; level with the lintels of the door openings. In the centre of the concourse; a massive cantilevered white concrete and marble staircase leads to the basement. Special waiver was sought to preserve it; as the height of the handrails would not meet current building code. Illuminating the voidAt the far end of the concourse; 2 walls in original white ceramic tile slope down through narrow voids to the basement below. The voids; likely added for air and light circulation; had been sealed over during previous renovations; but Kok Hiang reopened the space and installed sculptural light installations above them. Tidy rows of wires dangling naked bulbs at various lengths; some continuing straight through to the basement; draw the eye to the spaces without overpowering them.Retro 70s eventsThe ceiling in the main auditorium was of interest; with curious 70s-style curved details that Kok Hiang describes as almost marine in appearance. To update the acoustics of the great hall; he chose a wall treatment that referenced the original dark wood walls that flank the stage; creating a herringbone-like texture of wooden planks.A wainscot in matching dark wood covers the lower portion of the walls; providing a further design connection between the stage and hall. Functional spacesOver the years; every square foot of usable space was sectioned off for office rentals. Glass windows that overlooked the atrium lobby were boarded up. A recessed terrace with stunning views wasclosed off. Now; the spaces have been stripped back to their original bones and the upper levels reveal airy open spaces and wide corridors illuminated by natural light that streams in through restored windows. Design motifs In updating spaces for contemporary use; such as breakout rooms and meeting spaces; Kok Hiang retained the spirit of the building through décor motifs. Hexagons are instantly noticeable; adorning walls; carpets and glass panels. “If you look at the outside of the building;” he says; “you’ll see that it’s actually shaped like two elongated hexagons; so we replicated that.”These spaces are also where he has introduced colour: brass; chrome; shades of lime; orange and other earthy tones that provide subtle winks to the building’s 70s roots. The maritime theme is continued in the rounded corner detail; or ‘fillet’ of the internal doorways; a style that was popular in the 1970s. 43Tan Kok Hiang:4 things that contribute to a successful restoration4 Love the building“You need love. I’ve enjoyed this projectvery much.” More on Jurong Town Hall It is among the 7 national monuments built after World War II. According to the National Heritage Board; the building was gazetted as a monument because of its national significance; being built during Singapore’s early years of industrialisation and was the work of a pioneering group of local architects. The building is also part of Singapore’s modern architecture that reflect the gradual awakenings and aspirations of nation-building after 1945. Through careful balancing of land use needs and in consultation with the Conservation Advisory Panel and other stakeholders and communities; a significant number of modern buildings have been protected over the years. These were presented in URA’s exhibition; ‘Heritage of our modern past’ to celebrate their value and importance to Singapore’s built heritage. The exhibition was on display at the Singapore Heritage Festival in 2017 and 2018.For more information on Singapore’s built heritage; go to https://ura.sg/consportal.“Beauty has a huge role to play in society. It is one of those things in life that brings about positive feelings. For conserved buildings; usually one of the qualities they must have is aesthetic merit. So I’m dealing with a beautiful thing; and then I get to make it even more beautiful. How great is that?”“I try to go back in time and think; if I were1Know the history Chong Keat or part of his team; I would havebeen influenced by what was relevant to the times. So it’s about understanding the building through research and immersing yourself in itand the period.”2Know the architect3Add a light touch “If you look at Chong Keat’s previous buildings;his focus on horizontal lines creates a layeringeffect. I believe those architectural lines havegiven me a rule to follow.” “It’s about bringing out the building. If you haveto add anything; it’s about adding it so that itbecomes more relevant to the times withoutcompromising the original intent.” 44Photography by Darren SohI N S I G H T /A R T I N T H E C I T Y From a dot “Art is like life; it is not a sprint but a marathon to be enjoyed.” Renowned artist Sun Yu-li reminds us of the simple joys ofcreating art and its profound impact in a city. Writer Serene TngArtist Sun Yu-li has placed Singapore on the art world map; with his art displayed in prominent places worldwide. In Singapore; his distinctive sculptures can be seen in various public spaces such as those at Suntec City; Paragon Shopping Centre and the URA Centre. He discovered the universal language; a formal language of the metaphysical and uses his paintings and sculptures to express his concept of a transformational dot; connecting people; cultures and cities. He believes art is for everyone and has created unique opportunities that bring children and the community together to create art. His latest initiative (teaming up with ArtBeatz) was a live art jamming session over 2 days as part of URA’s third annual Urban Planning Festival. The result was beautiful art created by 200 youths at The URA Centre. We catch up with him on the importance of art in a city and how everyone can enjoy it.Why is art important in a city?Art in the city injects a new form of excitement. It is a vivid part of our memories of places. Sculptures offer a more permanent form of structure that create a lasting association with a particular place. For example; many of us think about the iconic dragon structure when we recall our growing up years at playgrounds in housing estates. The dragon structure is a vivid image we associate with playgrounds. And this has become part of our collective memory as a society and country. There are very few physical icons that can capture our different phases of modernisation. Sculptures; if placed properly can serve this purpose well. AboveArtist Sun Yu-li’s “Celestial Earth” sculpture at The URA Centre entrance (image at the top) and kids contributing to the live art jamming at URA’s urban planning festival; a collaborative project conceptualised by Sun Yu-li and facilitated by ArtBeatz. The project serves to recreate the splendour of modern civilisation and how it has come to be. 45You founded Sculpture Square which has become a significant space supporting artists in the realm of 3D art. How did this come about?It was by chance that I became the founder of Sculpture Square; an art space dedicated to the showcase of sculptures. From the mid-1990s.I worked from my studio at Sophia Road and walked to Middle Road often. 2 buildings at the junctionof Middle Road and Waterloo Street caught myeye due to their unique architectural features anda notice was put up in 1995 to transform the siteinto a 7 storey commercial building. With my architect’s instinct; I knew it was a pity for these 2 historical buildings to be demolished. As a sculptor; I was aware of the scarcity of venues dedicated to the display of 3 dimensional art.I shared this project with my friend and patron Edmund Cheng; deputy chairman of Wing Tai.Both of us had a common interest and worked earnestly on the Sculpture Square project. In 1996; under the National Arts Council Arts Housing scheme; both buildings were set aside for use asthe Sculpture Square.1Why do you involve the community in creating art together in Singapore and other cities?Art does not just belong to the museums or to those who can afford it. It has to be linked to the community. By involving the public; it enables everyone to enjoy the process and creation. It opens up minds and stimulates the inner creative instincts in all of us. And when one paints from the heart; there is no right or wrong.About the urban planning festivalThe month-long festival from 22 March to 27 April 2018 attracted 2;000 secondary and tertiary students and teachers from 35 schools; who gained deeper insights on urban planning and design through a series of exhibitions; workshops; talks and tours. Winners of the Challenge for the Urban and Built Environment (CUBE) 2017 were also announced. The top 3 winners were teams from Jurong Junior College; River Valley High School and Singapore Polytechnic. CUBE is an annual workshop and competition for tertiary schools organised by URA since 2009. The 9th edition saw over 145 students from 16 schools experience being urban planners first hand in November 2017; with ideas to turn Mei Chin estate into the new “heart” of Queenstown. Follow CUBE on facebook @CUBEStudentWorkshop for updates on more educational programmes in future.1 Sculpture Square has evolved since then. It no longer has a permanent exhibition space. 3D art continues to be supported through other means such as curating and commissioning. The Sculpture Square space is now home to Objectifs; the centre for photography and film.46At a glance We check out the latest events and happenings shaping the landscapes and neighbourhoods around us.Check out the P*DA recipients Check out the recipients of the President’s Design Award (P*DA) announced on 17 July 2018.

https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Get-Involved/Plan-Our-Future-SG/Innovative-Urban-Solutions/Age-friendly-city,The need for age-friendly neighbourhoodsDesigning age-friendly neighbourhoodsDesigning our nursing homes Ageing is a lifelong process; which results in physiological and psychological changes. For example; seniors may have difficulty sensing colours and spatial contrast; or have reduced depth and space cognition. Age-related cognitive decline may also affect memory and information handling. These changes affect how seniors experience their neighbourhoods.Seniors also tend to spend most of their time within their neighbourhoods. Hence; with well-designed neighbourhood spaces that can support seniors’ mobility; this will encourage them to go outdoors; increase opportunities for interaction and thereby improve their social and mental well-being.An age-friendly built environment supports seniors’ daily movements and encourages interaction with their neighbours. Aspects include:Under the Silver Zone scheme; the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has implemented road safety features at selected residential areas to make it safer and more convenient for older pedestrians to cross the road.These include distinctive signs; traffic-calming measures and road markings to reduce vehicle speeds and guide pedestrians to designated crossing points.3D road markings at the Silver Zone at Whampoa Drive help with traffic calming. (Photo: LTA)Part of the service road along Whampoa Drive was converted into a community space; to improve walkability and to provide residents with a rest point during their commute. (Photo: LTA)Walking is a common way for seniors to get to and from their daily activities. It is also important for healthy ageing as it enables seniors to remain physically and socially active.An age-friendly neighbourhood should enable seniors to walk around confidently and comfortably; without fear of falling.As part of a research study on age-friendly neighbourhoods led by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)1; CPG reviewed ways of enhancing the walking experience for seniors in Hong Kah North.An artist’s impression of sheltered connections to ease navigation; and with features to mitigate falls and provide comfort. (Artist’s impression: CPG)CPG’s design ideas were implemented in this prototype at Block 338; Bukit Batok Street 34; in the form of a bamboo motif; yellow line and bright green colour scheme at the void deck to highlight the sheltered connections; for seniors’ easier navigation. (Photo: CPG)This involved the re-design of existing sheltered connections for easier navigation; with features to provide comfort and reduce the risk of seniors falling. Selected design ideas were refined into a small-scale prototype in Hong Kah North. Safe and accessible public transport is vital for seniors to move from place to place; and continue connecting with people within and outside of their neighbourhood.The Yishun Integrated Transport Hub incorporates physical features that are senior- and dementia-friendly; including barrier-free boarding and alighting areas with priority queues and reserved seats; and prominent signage for easier wayfinding..At Yishun Integrated Transport Hub; there is prominent toilet signage at eye level for enhanced visibility. (Photo: SMRT Buses Ltd)Non-slip floor stickers guide commuters to service nodes. (Photo: SMRT Buses Ltd)With the onset of mobility; visual and cognitive impairment; concerns about safety can discourage seniors from leaving their homes.To encourage seniors to come out of their homes and interact with their community; Lekker Architects and Tierra Design explored design interventions to create engaging and inclusive spaces for seniors in the neighbourhoods of MacPherson and Toa Payoh West respectively; as part of the same SUTD-led study.Lekker Architects turned an underutilised void deck space into a pop-up kopitiam named “Kam & Goh”; offering a comfortable and familiar environment for seniors to interact; instead of staying in their homes alone.Social interaction; regular exercise and cognitive stimulating activities improve quality of life and may even delay the onset of dementia.The “Kam & Goh” kopitiam; a mobile kopitiam deployed at the Macpherson Estate to encourage social interaction among seniors. (Photo: Lekker Architects)Tierra Design’s idea of “Walk-and-Play!” turns ordinary moments such as walking to the MRT station or wet market into opportunities for children; adults and seniors to play; through designing paths that incorporate physical and mental exercises.This path design has simple psychomotor designs drawn on it; to encourage regular exercise. (Image: Tierra Design)Path designs can also be used to encourage mental stimulation; by turning colourful features into simple games that challenge cognitive and motor skills. (Image: Tierra Design)Spending time in nature brings many benefits; including improved mental and physical well-being.Therapeutic Gardens are purposefully designed gardens by the National Parks Board (NParks) that facilitate interactions between visitors and the healing elements of nature.The gardens’ layout and landscapes are specifically designed to stimulate the senses; invoke reminiscence of childhood or daily life; and provide active and restorative spaces to improve the seniors’ well-being.Seniors participating in Horticulture Therapy in a Therapeutic Garden. (Photo: NParks)Nursing home designs have evolved to provide better living environments for residents and to strengthen the integration of nursing homes with the surrounding communities.Key design considerations include:A research study led by the National University of Singapore (NUS) aims to recommend innovative design typologies for nursing homes that support person-centric care models; and are well-integrated with the surrounding communities1. Two design firms were shortlisted to propose ideas based on the principles established by the research teams.Examples of design ideas by the selected firms:A “Social Corridor” in a conceptual nursing home proposed by FARM Architects and STUCK Design. It is modelled after the HDB common corridor; which would connect a sky garden and different levels. This gives residents the autonomy to walk around and interact within a secure environment.

https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Media-Room/Media-Releases/pr19-44,Supporting ageing through design Design solutions that support the ageing of Singaporeans as more live longer and healthier lives; are the focus of the latest Urban Lab exhibition launched today. Organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA); the eighth instalment of the Urban Lab exhibition series was opened by the Minister of State for National Development and Manpower Zaqy Mohamad at the URA Centre. Singaporeans have one of the world’s highest life expectancies. Meanwhile; the elderly are forming an increasingly larger proportion of the population – one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older in 2030; compared to today’s one in seven. At the same time; more of the elderly are living alone – approximately 83;000 seniors will be living alone in 2030; compared to 43;000 currently. In light of these trends; the exhibition ‘Designing Our Age-Friendly City’ considers how the built environment can support Singaporeans as they age. It examines how the designs of our neighbourhoods can help people comfortably age-in-place; as well as how the designs of nursing homes can evolve to provide comfort; relevant care and better assimilation within neighbourhoods. Among the projects exhibited; are two collaborations among government agencies; research institutions and design firms; targeted at providing practical design applications and principles for these environments1. Broadly; the exhibition covers: “As we plan and shape Singapore for the future; we have to take into account how people’s needs might change as they grow older. Hence this exhibition is a timely exploration of aspects and strategies that various players involved in shaping our built environment could consider; to support people in living healthy and happy lives;” said URA Chief Executive Officer Lim Eng Hwee.  Ms Charlene Chang; Group Director; Ageing Planning Office; Ministry of Health (MOH) said; “Ageing should be a positive force and we have taken steps to tap on the strengths of our seniors by enabling them to age well. MOH will continue to work with our stakeholders and the community; to provide a holistic range of programmes to help our seniors stay active and socially engaged; even as we enhance accessibility and quality of aged care services.”‘Designing Our Age-Friendly City’ will be exhibited at The URA Centre atrium from 17 October 2019 to 31 December 2019. The public can explore key highlights of the exhibition by joining one of the guided tours led by URA volunteers.

https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Resources/Ideas-and-Trends/Ageing-and-social-capital,Ageing and Social CapitalFuture EconomyPlanningHeritagePlanning Academics; designers and policy makers are coming together in a seminal project to develop planning and design guidelines for ageing friendly neighbourhoods in Singapore.When referring to an age-friendly neighbourhood; we should use the word “ageing friendly” instead; suggests Dr Belinda Yuen; the research director and programme lead of the Lee Li Ming Programme in Ageing Urbanism at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities; Singapore University Technology and Design (SUTD). “Ageing is a process whereas age denotes a label. Ageing is not the end of life; instead; there is a lot to celebrate as one moves on to later years.”She is leading a seminal 18-month research project that started from July 2017; seeking to understand the connection between the neighbourhood’s built environment and older persons’ social; physical and mental health. For this project; SUTD is also joined by the Geriatric Education & Research Institute; which will provide research on the public health and medical needs of ageing Singaporeans.Envisioning an ideal ageing friendly neighbourhood; Dr Yuen says it should be welcoming (inclusive for all); walkable; wonderful (with attractive spaces) and warm (referring to human interactions). “Our task is clear;” says Dr Yuen; “to provide the opportunities that encourage older people to get out of the house and to support them in their capacity to use the spaces around them; otherwise they may become housebound. The physical infrastructure and facilities are very important in providing the stage for activities to play out and opportunities for interaction that can help address loneliness and social isolation.”Something as simple as a bench can become critical. Dr Yuen suggests that benches placed in public spaces in Singapore should be made of materials that are relevant to the local climate; that are comfortable and have arm rests for older people to use to lift themselves up. Placement is also important; along common paths and at short intervals. Even the angles at which they are placed make a difference; as benches facing each other are more conducive for social interaction.Based on the project scope; Dr Yuen and her team will focus on three neighbourhoods with different population profiles; topography; and land use mix; to provide local quantitative and qualitative insights. They have also undertaken benchmark comparisons with other ageing-friendly initiatives in 10 cities around the world.A seminal study on ageing-friendly neighbourhoods is looking more closely at shaping and designing engaging spaces for older persons; including places like Coffee Corner at Toa Payoh View; a social gathering space initiated by local champion Philip Phajan Singh.Once the research is completed; it will be used to produce broad planning and design guidelines that can be applied to existing and future neighbourhoods. There may also be opportunities to do post-implementation evaluation of subsequent improvements made within the three selected neighbourhoods. For this reason; Dr Yuen calls it a “dream project.”“Singapore is the first to approach the issue of ageing-friendly neighbourhoods from research through intervention prototyping to evaluation;” says Dr Yuen. The project brings together academics; policy makers and architects. Funded by the National Research Foundation and Ministry of National Development (under the Land and Liveability National Innovation Challenge) and led by URA; some other partners include the Ministry of Health; Building & Construction Authority; Agency for Integrated Care and Housing & Development Board.Her team is producing up to 10 deliverables; including an environmental audit toolkit which can be used by planners; architects; local councils or even residents themselves to assess the ageing-friendliness of their neighbourhood spaces. A draft has already been presented to some Town Councils for feedback.The Toa Payoh West market and its surrounding spaces have become a focal point for many in the neighbourhood.The project also includes three architectural firms; CPG Corporation; Tierra Design and Lekker Architects. Each firm has been assigned to focus on one of the three neighbourhoods identified as part of the project; and come up with context specific design solutions.“An explicit goal of ageing friendly design is to make sure that people's life space mobility doesn't get constricted; the amount that someone is willing and feels enabled to travel beyond their immediate home environment;” says co-founder of Lekker Architects Ong Ker-Shing. This means walkability; benches and places that inspire social interaction are high on her list of priorities. Wayfinding is another.“These days; everything shouts for your attention;” she says. “There's no quiet fabric that forms the background; similar to what you see in older cities. With redevelopment; it’s hard to have a neighbourhood that is both legible in the scale of the buildings and the neighbourhood itself; while retaining recognisable landmarks. That's confusing as you get older; when maybe you forget things or find a lot of information hard to sift out. So one thing we've wondered is whether there can be a simplification of the visual information at a neighbourhood level.”Tierra Design’s co-founder Franklin Po adds: “The dilemma is to understand the neighbourhood and the flows of where people are walking and then to figure out where all the spots are that need to be fixed.” If it were up to him; Franklin says he would do away with every step and level change within the main walkways of the neighbourhood and move all roads and parking to peripheral areas; creating a seamless corridor of green and open spaces that is safe and inclusive for everyone. For exercise; there should be pathways outside of these main pathways to give people more choices.Similar to Dr Yuen and Ong; Po places importance on how people use their neighbourhood spaces to form social connections; observing how residents gravitate to some spaces more than others; and the various ways that spaces are used for ad hoc activities. “Remember; people used to live in kampongs at ground level;” says Po; “so when you put them in apartment blocks; you've changed the social fabric. We want to bring people out from their apartments; back down to ground level. It’s a big issue if people don't want to mingle or don’t even know who their neighbours are.”Older persons within the Toa Payoh View neighbourhood have re-purposed common public spaces into their own gathering spots like this one; close to the Toa Payoh West market.He adds: “We are exploring the difference between designing spaces for people and designing spaces for people to create by themselves;” says Po. “We feel that if we give ownership to people; not just the elderly but people of all ages; then they will actually use these spaces more often.”It’s about building social capital. “What we're trying to do in communities is to build social cohesion and providing amenities that will actually promote people coming together with different interests and to find the kind of interest that they like.” By Jennifer EvelandPhotography by Chee Boon PinUrban Redevelopment AuthorityVisit our revamped Gallery!Receive our monthly updatesVisit our revamped Gallery! copyrighted 2020 Urban Redevelopment Authority  Last Updated : 14 Feb 2020 
https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Resources/Ideas-and-Trends/Cohousing-for-successful-ageing,Co-housing for Successful Ageing-in-PlaceFuture EconomyPlanningHeritagePlanning An increasing number of cities are planning and implementing co-housing residential projects. Co-housing refers to a housing model that seeks to promote greater community involvement and intergenerational mutual support within a residential development through the following practices:As the emphasis of co-housing is on communality over privacy; the model typically has more extensive shared facilities — such as shared kitchens — compared to living in condominiums or gated communities. Co-housing should also be differentiated from co-living; which involves transient living arrangements that typically cater to a niche demographic — for example; millennial entrepreneurs.The scope of how co-housing is defined is also broadening. In Vienna; Austria; city authorities and developers; with the addition of resident input; have been playing active roles in shaping the Austrian capital’s Baugruppen co-housing developments for positive outcomes. In Denmark and Japan; the social sector is also involved in leading a handful of co-housing projects; in particular for seniors1. Cities are recognising that intergenerational co-housing can give seniors the social support they need while they remain empowered as independent actors in a connected community.An increasing number of urban residents are preferring to “age in place” as they grow older2. “Ageing in place” may be understood as the ability to live in one’s community — as opposed to living in a care facility — comfortably and independently even as one ages. However; currently; there are few intermediate options (between assisted living and remaining in a home without help) that seek to both maintain the seniors’ quality of life and improve their mental well-being without the need for relocation. As a result; oftentimes; elderly residents tend to move into a home care facility; away from their existing community; once they begin to exhibit a marked decrease in mobility and an increased reliance on others to complete everyday tasks.A 2011 survey of co-housing residents in the US showed that 96 percent of them reported an improved quality of life and 75 percent felt their physical health was better than others of the same age3. Moreover; 81 percent of the residents engaged in sharing of equipment and household appliances with one another; indicating high levels of trust within the community. With these benefits in mind; the article looks at the possible role that co-housing; as a model; could play in enabling seniors to effectively age in place.To allow residents to effectively age in place; various co-housing projects have looked at enhancing the flexibility and range of uses for spaces in residential blocks via modifiable; replicable and low-cost measures — such as retractable walls4 — that involve minimal structural change.In Vienna’s Seestern Aspern (a 27-apartment intergenerational co-housing project); each floor is designed with units that incorporate a “flex” space; which residents could choose to eventually give up when; for example; their children grow up and leave home. Creating flex spaces may facilitate downsizing — and hence cost-saving — for seniors without them having to relocate. The doors to these spaces can be resealed with drywall; and the space can be either returned to communal use; or availed to an individual or the neighbouring units for rent.By enabling the units to be modifiable; the residents are able to better optimise the use of their space to accommodate their changing needs over time; and organise the space around them to be opened up for other uses that could be shared with the community; if desired. However; for successful co-sharing of such flex spaces and to create a communal culture; a number of co-housing projects look beyond just the provision of such space; but at ways to engage resident participation.Flexible spaces for community use in a co-housing development. Image credit: Einszueins Architektur (Click to enlarge)The participatory aspect of co-housing could enable residents to effectively age in place in number of ways. For example; Vienna’s Aspern Baugruppen is a cluster of five co-housing projects that encouraged resident participation5 at different stages of development. During the design and configuration stage of the co-housing development; city authorities appointed community development advisors to each project to facilitate interactions between to-be residents; developers and architects.Ernst Gruber; a consultant involved in the project; said that several possible floor plans were shared with the prospective residents to allow them to choose the final plan in discussion with one another and with other stakeholders. The residents were also able to suggest a list of communal facilities that they were prepared to share as part of the co-housing development.The aforementioned Seestern Aspern is a co-housing project within Aspern Baugruppen that incorporates a communal kitchen and laundry space. According to Gruber; “the most effective kinds of shared spaces in co-housing are communal kitchens and flexible use spaces.” By allowing the residents to take part in the initial creation of their living spaces; including the shared facilities; the project aimed to evoke a sense of co-ownership between the residents and to mitigate downstream dispute on the shared use of space.Moreover; “prospective residents not only have a role in deciding which spaces to include; they are also assigned responsibility in managing these spaces;” Gruber adds. Beyond involvement in initial planning and design stages; the eventual curation and management of the shared spaces within co-housing offers long-term opportunities to empower seniors to age in place and keep them meaningfully engaged with the rest of society on a day-to-day basis.Likewise; the neighbourhood of Orba in Valencia; Spain; has planned to adopt the intergenerational co-housing approach for nearly 2;800 apartments as part of a larger revitalisation project. One aspect of the plan calls for “the addition of doors; staircases; corridors; common areas and satellite rooms” to better connect the 5;000-odd residents; many of whom are seniors6; creating an ecosystem of shared space and resources7.In particular; spaces that have been vacated over time are to be repurposed as communal spaces; such as woodworking workshops and small design studios that leverage on the existing skills of senior residents. Senior residents with a reduced need for space can also choose to avail their spaces (to another tenant or for communal use) and lower their expenses; like how the flex spaces in Vienna’s Seestern Aspern work. Such ideas could make any co-housing project visitor-worthy and create an activity loop whereby the senior residents could engage in skills transfer to the younger generation; and remain socially active within the community.In Singapore; the intergenerational co-housing concept — as described in the examples — has yet to be implemented. Hence; there are evident opportunities to explore new residential typologies that could cater to the growing preference of the senior population to age in place and remain socially engaged within the community.Established in 1976 and currently within a public housing (Housing and Development Board) rental block; the AWWA Senior Community Home8 in Ang Mo Kio is a step towards integrating senior residents within the larger community to facilitate ageing in place. While AWWA’s co-housing model is only targeted at residents 60 years of age and above; the location itself — which occupies levels two to four of the housing block — enables the elderly residents to remain in a wider community neighbourhood setting instead of living in an otherwise more institutionalised environment. Regular activities and events are also organised to facilitate active social participation and interaction between the residents and the community.While AWWA’s co-housing model for seniors shows the potential for the co-housing model in Singapore to be implemented on a larger scale as an intergenerational model akin to the Seestern Aspern and Orba projects; the success of co-housing projects is still highly dependent on existing social and cultural conditions. In Singapore; co-housing concepts are relatively nascent; which may suggest that the business case of this housing model — and the social receptiveness towards it — has yet to gain strong momentum. More market sensing; pilots and studies are needed to see if this promising housing model can indeed take off in future.Urban Redevelopment AuthorityVisit our revamped Gallery!Receive our monthly updatesVisit our revamped Gallery! copyrighted 2020 Urban Redevelopment Authority  Last Updated : 14 Feb 2020 
https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Resources/Ideas-and-Trends/Designing-an-intergenerational-city,Designing an Intergenerational City Future EconomyPlanningHeritagePlanning Aging societies are prompting cities to rethink how they are structured and operate; both physically and socially.“An aging and multigenerational society presents several challenges if left unmanaged;” asserts Dr Emi Kiyota; President and founder of Ibasho; a US-based non-profit organisation that strives to create socially integrated and sustainable communities that value their elders.“With the number of generations increasing from three to four; and even five in some communities; this has the potential to isolate various age groups; and cause social and economic harm.”An aging society can add significant financial burden to national governments. It also increases financial pressure on families and society to take care of the elderly. Social challenges are prevalent: the elderly can feel excluded from society and are often the subject of stereotypical attitudes; where they are seen as a burden to younger generations.While the physical effects of aging are well understood; the social integration of the elderly among younger generations is a field where comparatively little research has been conducted1. Furthermore; studies that explore how various generations interact — not just the elderly; but between other age groups — are equally in short supply.“A common problem faced by cities globally is that research in the field of intergenerational interaction is limited;” explains Dr Leng Leng Thang; Council Member; Families for Life; and Associate Professor; Department of Japanese Studies; National University of Singapore. “Relatively little is known in this area when compared to other fields like medical research; but the studies that have taken place highlight the benefits intergenerational interaction can create.”Designing cities that cater for all ages is a relatively new undertaking. Indeed; as the number of generations within society widens; the importance of this field to urban planners will likely increase. Cities should not focus on catering to one generation at the expense of alienating or excluding another — this would lead to widespread social challenges; such as loneliness; and mental and physical health issues.The value different generations bring to families; communities and the workforce are diverse and mutually beneficial. For instance; the elderly can teach the youth about culture; history and life experiences; and conversely; younger generations can introduce new technology and other trends to the elderly.A 2017 study conducted by US-based non-profit organisations Generations United and The Eisner Foundation argues the case for greater intergenerational interaction2 . Titled I Need You; You Need Me: The Young; The Old; And What We Can Achieve Together; the study found that two-thirds of adults said they wanted to spend time with people who are not their age; while three-quarters wished there were more opportunities to get to know different age groups.The study asserts that when generations interact together; stereotypes break down and attitudes change. This fosters mutual empathy and improves community harmony. The study pinpoints how adults can share their knowledge and experience with the young through mentoring and tutoring; and provide attention and emotional support. It also highlights how intergenerational programmes can improve the social skills; confidence and decision-making of the youth.These findings are supported by another report; Hidden in Plain Sight: How Intergenerational Relationships Can Transform Our Future3; co-published by the Stanford Center on Longevity; Encore.org and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The report highlights how older adults’ “years of living give them an almost intangible ability to communicate and model non-cognitive skills and to help young people develop those key traits”. On the other hand; “in promoting the well-being of the next generation; older adults experience fulfillment and purpose in their own lives”.“For intergenerational dialogue to flow more readily; there must be an environment where generations can integrate seamlessly;” states Dr Thang. “There must be space conducive for engagements; design that integrates and not segregates different generations in the same space; and programmes and policies that aim at breaking institutional isolation in favour of dialogues across the generations.”Shared spaces and activities that are housed under one roof make intergenerational contact informal and ongoing. Countries that have successfully created shared spaces include Japan; the UK and the US. In Japan; for instance; the Inside the Ibasho Café in Ōfunato; Iwate Prefecture — a scheme founded by Dr Kiyota — is a space where elders look after other elders; help young mothers by watching their children; and organise multi-generational activities to share their wisdom to community members of all ages. Such places are cost-effective; and enhance the social capital among the community members.Inside the Ibasho Café in Ōfunato; Iwate Prefecture; Japan. Founded by Dr Kiyota; the facility allows elders to interact with other age groups and act as a vital source of wisdom. Drinks and snacks are available in the café; and are served by older members of their community.(Photo: Ibasho.org)While the value of intergenerational spaces is clear; the planning and designing of these spaces are not so simple. A study by Danish urban designers arki_lab4set about to discover the main challenges in designing such spaces as well as various solutions to overcome these issues.Three findings are particularly noteworthy:Focusing specifically on the planning of successful intergenerational spaces; the UK’s Oxford Institute of Population Ageing5held a workshop in 2015 with the aim of creating a set of guiding principles for urban planners to consider.The workshop suggests that choice is a key principle to consider when designing intergenerational spaces — hence allowing people of all generations to engage in intergenerational activities on their own terms and not involuntarily. Planners should also consider what can be added to existing spaces; and conduct activities that are meaningful to people emotionally; physically and economically. In addition; authorities must plan and operationalise intergenerational spaces on a range of scales. These could include large areas that are co-housed in public spaces; such as a shopping mall or public park; or they could reside in more intimate settings; such as a local community centre.Throughout its modern development; Singapore has built spaces that allow intergenerational interactions to spontaneously take place. These spaces include the void decks of public housing blocks; where childcare facilities and kindergartens are located near informal social spaces for the elderly; as well as the children playgrounds and elderly fitness corners located contiguously. Locating such amenities in close proximity to each other is the first step in fostering intergenerational interactions. A further step would be to enhance such spaces with universal design standards. There is a need to consciously include and design such spaces sensitively to push the possibilities of intergenerational interaction.The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has engaged in studies and workshops aimed at exploring the impact of co-locating social facilities to reap positive impacts such as intergenerational interaction6. Involving other governmental agencies and the private sector; a key finding of URA’s work is how intergenerational spaces are only one part of the process towards developing a place for intergenerational exchange — the other part is to organise programmes and design spaces that encourage interaction.While co-location is a core component of intergenerational interaction; equally important is co-programming and co-sharing of common spaces. In the future; such amenities could be planned and designed upfront for and with the private sector and users for co-programming and co-sharing of spaces to occur.Possible intergenerational space concepts; created during URA's design thinking workshop.The planning; design and programming of intergenerational spaces; and by extension; the intergenerational city; is an endeavour that challenges the age-based categories that stakeholders typically operate with. Because of this; a successfully designed intergenerational space would need the collaboration of all.Operators and users will need to be persuaded of the benefits of such spaces; and be willing to take risks in collaborating with new partners. Planners and policymakers will need to create mechanisms to incorporate intergenerational planning into the planning process. Designers will need to create thoughtful spaces that maximises such benefits.While the challenge is significant; so too are the benefits. Intergenerational spaces will be the key in turning the elderly from a supposed burden in society to a clear asset for all generations.Urban Redevelopment AuthorityVisit our revamped Gallery!Receive our monthly updatesVisit our revamped Gallery! copyrighted 2020 Urban Redevelopment Authority  Last Updated : 14 Feb 2020

The speed at which populations are ageing underlines the urgency of this research. The United Nations Population Fund predicts that the proportion of the global population aged 60 or older will rise from about 12 per cent today to almost 22 per cent by 20501. This is particularly acute in developed economies. In Japan; for instance; a quarter of the nation’s population is aged 60 or above — this is expected to rise to 30 per cent by 2030.Despite the existence of facilities and support programmes that cater for the aged; challenges remain within neighbourhoods that need to be addressed. These include; but are not limited to:“Creating age-friendly environments and investing in preventative programmes in a context of economic austerity can be challenging for cities;” says Samuèle Rémillard-Boilard; PhD Researcher in Sociology; School of Social Sciences; The University of Manchester. “Addressing diversity and inequalities in ageing; and promoting social inclusion is key to making cities more age-friendly.”Cities are taking steps to plan and design age-friendly neighbourhoods; and have begun researching the needs and preferences of the elderly. “Governments and businesses need to see evidence of the challenges the elderly pose; as well as the positive contribution they can make to society and the economy;” explains Professor Hiroko Akiyama of the Institute of Gerontology; University of Tokyo. In-depth studies that unearth challenging issues will allow the public and private sector to develop effective solutions; as well as broaden their understanding of the aged in general. To better understand the value and development of age-friendly neighbourhoods; Professor Akiyama argues that studies must examine both physical and social issues and offer practical; easily implementable solutions that involve all actors and stakeholders. With people living longer and birth rates falling; Japan’s aging population means that facilities and amenities are becoming increasingly obsolete. This is exemplified in the small city of Kashiwa; which typifies these challenges. “The existing social infrastructure of Kashiwa was built when only five per cent of residents were aged 65 or older;” explains Professor Akiyama. “But as the population rapidly aged; the city had to rethink how it approached matters such as housing; healthcare; employment and education.”In response; the University of Tokyo’s Institute of Gerontology embarked on research initiatives to better understand and develop age-friendly cities. In collaboration with public partners; the institute conducted a large-scale social experiment to assess and improve the elderly liveability of a typical Japanese neighbourhood.The city’s 5;000-unit Toyoshikidai Danchi residential development was built in the 1960s and designed for young families and professionals. However; by 2010 more than 40 per cent of residents were aged 65 or over2. To ascertain the challenges facing Kashiwa’s aged and map out potential solutions; researchers conducted interviews; symposiums and seminars with Toyoshikidai Danchi residents; businesses; community groups and government officials. The research revealed the need of seniors to engage with both peers and other age groups — studies cited by the institute confirm that a decline in physical independence is notably pronounced among elderly who have minimal content with family or neighbours3 — and stressed the need to introduce newer; smaller units specifically designed for aged residents. The institute also revealed the vast diversity of the city’s seniors; and highlighted the willingness of retirees to work — more than 80 per cent of seniors said they wanted to work in some capacity4. To address these issues; Kashiwa launched two initiatives:   Older persons working as professional child carers in Kashiwa City; Japan. (Photo: Institute of Gerontology; University of Tokyo) Vertical gardening in Kashiwa City. (Photo: Institute of Gerontology; University of Tokyo)The impact of these initiatives has been significant: seniors live comfortably; contribute to the local economy and support their individual needs through employment. The recommendations made by the research team have since become public municipality policies — not just in Kashiwa; but also in other cities across Japan. “We purposely built the model in Kashiwa so that other cities would say; ‘If Kashiwa can do this; so can we’;” enthuses Professor Akiyama.Research conducted by The University of Manchester revealed that an unintended consequence of urban development is increased alienation of the elderly — physically; socially and emotionally7. With the two-pronged goal of understanding the needs of seniors and increasing the age-friendliness of the city; the Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing (MICRA) was launched in 2010.A notable feature of MICRA’s work is the involvement of older people in age-related research. Hired to examine experiences of ageing in three neighbourhoods of the city; the institute trained 18 local older volunteers as co-researchers. These seniors not only contributed to the initiative by sharing their own skills and personal knowledge; but also conducting 68 interviews with older people; who were previously difficult to engage with.Key findings revealed by the co-researchers included8:In response to the initiative’s findings; Manchester City Council set about making changes to public spaces; making them more age-friendly. For instance; it rebuilt public pathways with minimal steps and invested in age-friendly public transport. In conjunction with several non-government organisations; the city council formed numerous social enterprises; where older persons can meet other older persons and take part in social activities.

(Photo: Mark Waugh)The Age-Friendly Design Group has developed a set of age-friendly design guidelines for the city. Made up of retired architects; planners; design students and urban designers; the group tests and hones these guidelines through a number of demonstrator projects; and seeks to understand how age-friendly design works in practice. Among others these include the Age-Friendly Seating and Sense of Place project9; a study that revealed the importance of seating design and location to the elderly; and the Alternative Age-Friendly Handbook10; essays that explore different approaches to age-friendly urban planning.“These projects highlight the role urban planners can play in the creation of age-friendly cities;” says Rémillard-Boilard. “By removing barriers in the social and built environment; involving older people in the decision-making process; and considering how older people experience their environments; urban planners can help cities become more inclusive and responsive.”Kashiwa and Manchester demonstrate the value of research that examines the viewpoints and needs of elderly communities. Access to amenities; transportation and housing are obviously key; but the findings from these cities also highlight the importance of social infrastructure and community support to age-friendly neighbourhoods. Kashiwa created an integrated community care system and a means for the elderly to financially support themselves and the local economy. Manchester gave the elderly a voice; a sense of ownership and the opportunity to participate in the research process; which has been crucial in understanding the elderly; and planning and designing age-friendly cites. The studies also underline the importance of making the aged feel part of society; rather than seeing themselves as a burden to the younger generation or the state.To meet the needs of Singapore’s elderly; the Urban Redevelopment Authority in collaboration with the Ministry of Health; Agency of Integrated Care; Housing Development Board and Building Construction Authority; have begun a research project that examines the impact of urban design on the aged. Titled “Innovative Planning and Design of Age-friendly Neighbourhoods in Singapore”; the initiative’s objectives are multifold: to assess the age-friendliness of neighbourhoods; investigate how persons aged 55 years and above understand and interact with their community and built environment; and ascertain the connections between a neighbourhood’s built environment and an older person’s social; physical and mental health.Using both qualitative and quantitative research; and working with architects and urban planners; the project’s findings will be used to develop planning guidelines and context-specific design strategies and interventions that can be applied to Singapore neighbourhoods.Like the efforts of Kashiwa and Manchester; Singapore’s initiative is ultimately aimed at making the city-state more elderly-friendly; and to provide insights that can be used by planners in Singapore and beyond. 1.http://www.unfpa.org/ageing2.
